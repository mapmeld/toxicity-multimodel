Mezcla (for pick up )

Any Chinese place for orange chicken

99 miles to philly for the obvious (extra provolone, mushrooms, hot peppers fuck yeeeaaah)

Lantern Thai for drunken noodle and ga cary  (or coconut chicken soup)

Sao Mai for ...anything really.

Fucking walk to mighty Quinn's just be sweet Jesus, fuck yes.Not everyone in NYC is a struggling starving cliche aspiration/profession. Since it seems we're geared towards young people, it seems most people I have met either:

* Got a job either intentionally or unintentionally here

* Have connections from having grown up in or around the area

* Have connections from being rich as fuck

* Are in finance/fashion/media in some way and are often one of the above two categories

* Are struggling working 6 days a week at 2 jobs to pull in $2k after tax half of which goes to rent

* Live with their significant other where 2 sub $2k salaries and $1.4k rent is almost reasonableYou'll need about 1k a month even for a shitty studio.  Here's a tip. Find roomates ASAP. Don't walk behind ditzy dog walkers. Too much shit. 

Edit: wordIs the building manager the same name that's on your lease?

You could try writing a formal letter with your girlfriend to the landlord expressing why it's become a problem for her. I would mention the drug use if she has not already. If I were you I would continue to make complaints to 311 or the m local precinct. I would not try talking to the person and risk creating any hostility since they're typically right outside the door.

The situation sounds pretty stressful. Hope you two manage to work something out so you and your girlfriend feel safer. My girlfriend and I had a somewhat similar situation where a tenant and his friend used to sit outside right under our bedroom window all night long drinking, smoking, and just generally being loud assholes. Asked if they could please not do that and they made it even more of a thing to do it. People can be really fucking inconsiderate.The one on 7th ave between 40th and 39th does. I have never ordered, just saw the number and said, yep, maybe one day. 

Edit: Damn you. I have achieved a new low. I ordered from the aforementioned mcdonalds and am reveling in my sloth and gluttony. Fuck yeah 20 piece nuggets. Are you in a fucked up old building? Are you rhinocerosesing around it? Does your landlord have any insensitive to encourage you to leave? Have you talked to all your neighbors? What neighborhood? Families? I have a kid below me... it sucks for them and it sucks for me. your airbnb host is a jerk. when i used to live alone and be an airbnb host i would 100% let my guests leave their bags in my apt as long as they needed, as long as they were gone and i could have my apt back. As others have pointed out, there is the risk of death thing. But it is also incredibly inefficient and unlikely to be capable of beating your apartment. Not to mention the whole risk of shit catching on fire. Basically, this idea is really fucking stupid. Technically the owner could ask them to leave.

But does it really matter? It's cold as fuck outside and they just want to stay warm. And god forbid anything goes down they are right there if anyone needs help.

I would be happy if cops wanted to hang out in my lobbyDon't be an asshole. Its cold outsideBecause Century 21 is a terrible shit show. It's non stop tourists from open to close. They probably hate their job and get paid very little. Plus, they *can* get away with it because it's tourists who will never be back to shop there again. I mean, you got treated like shit last time you went and STILL went back on your next trip here. yah they are dumbasses there...also duane reade has shit cashiers as wellI have the $70 unlimited plan (although I think it's no longer available at that price) and I fucking love it. It works pretty much anywhere in the city sans a few spots. 

If you spend your whole time in the city, fucking get it. If not, it's fucking terrible.

Customer service is also friendly as shit. They sometimes let you pay shit later according to a few friends. I always pay on time so I don't know if that's true or not. Did you ask why? Could be something as innocuous as clearing space during rush hour.

Or they could just be power hungry dicks.

Not sure about your rights within Grand Central though. It is a public place, but it's different than the sidewalk.Meh, it's just not you. They have to do this with the homeless and a lot of other people who they witness staying in one place for too long. Heck, they even stopped a guy who was talking about fossils embedded in the stone floors when I was there once! His friend was filming him and they were like, politely, "move along please". Let's face it, GCT is a prime target for terrorists. Unfortunately, they chapped your ass today. Don't take offense, they have to walk a fine line between "this is a free country" and "we don't know if this guy is ok" about a million times a day. I absolutely hate time warner. We currently have an outage in my neighborhood, and it rarely operates at advertised speeds. No knowledge of optimum, but if I were you I'd try to use the threat of switching to time warner to get some free/discounted shit from optimum. Keep your head up, life has a tendency to kick everyone in the ass. My suggestions would be Iron horse (make sure you spin the wheel), dead rabbit, M1-5, Rudys (free hot dog with each drink). These aren't really too classy but its fun and kinda casual with a small group of friends. Happy 25th birthday. NYC is that awesome. And it can suck. There are a fuckload of great things about it and a fuckload of awful things. Like living anywhere, it's all about your personality and what you value and will put up with for what you value. 

I left and came back because NYC is basically less horrible than the rest of the US when it comes to what I want out of where I live and I'm too fucking lazy to try to immigrate somewhere else. 

That said, I still hope to retire to NOLA. My favorite hole in the wall in that area is Roti Roll Bombay Frankie.  Fucking delish, I highly highly recommend.Put it on the sidewalk and it will be gone in a day, one way or another

edit: and if for some reason it's not gone in a day, list it under craigslist free section and then it will be gone in a matter of minutes. There's people that do nothing else but drive around picking up free shit off craigslist.The one closest to the bar that you stumble out of at 3 in the morning.   That shit is the best!You could try something touristy that's completely outside your regular routine, preferably something with panoramic views of Manhattan. Walk over one of the East River bridges at sunset, take the Staten Island Ferry, go up a building with an observation deck.

Basically every time I walk over the Manhattan Bridge, I'm like "holy shit".

Or spend the afternoon strolling Central Park, see a Broadway/off-Broadway show, etc. Any of the iconic things that might be top 10 in a Lonely Planet will either invigorate you or fuck you right off. That's a 50/50 chance of success!Look on Craigslist for non-NYC apartments and note their prices. That will definitely give you a "holy shit I live in NYC" feeling.Should we have a support group? Fucking winter.Damn my non-generic nameEven if it does work I'd still feel like an asshole ordering. I can suck it up and cook myself some pasta.Pulled pork, bourbon, SWTOR. Bring the motherfucking ruckusEver read someone's reddit post and immediately thought "This person is the shit."The freak out is more "don't let shit go wrong". They rather keep everyone home and off the streets than allow themselves to look like assholes if thing really do go wrong. On top of that for NYC to shut down it's going to take some time so unfortunately we have to get bombarded with the info for 24 hours prior to anything happening.I am forced to work from home, although I could technically walk from Astoria which would probably take me around 70 minutes or so.

Eh, fuck it. Last time I had to work from home was after Sandy. I spontaneously decided to hit a local super market and then bake a cake instead.Seriously, just rent a room at a restaurant or bar. Don't be the dick that does this in an apartment building. I know, right?!  I never thought I'd have an easier time meeting women to do the sex with than men to just hang out with.  People have suggested meetup, but I don't want to do an active activity, I just want to plant my ass at a bar and have a few drinks and bullshit about politics or something.  

We need something like **Bro Tinder**.

PS I'm out of the country at the moment, but PM me in about a month if you still want a drinking buddy... :-)White Castle. 

Alright, not the best, but the one I eat the most. Damn it, now I want white castle. Umami BurgerI have gotten a 70$ ticket for not moving my car even though i had paid the meter. Apparently if it says "2 hour metered parking" it means you HAVE to move it after 2 hours, you can't just pay for parking time. Such fucking bullshit People still line up for those salty pimps from big gay ice cream shop. Yes.  I always take whatever they offer then bitch them out if they harass me.Yes it's criminal, and buying from these assholes encourages them.  Please don't.Eh fuck the haters. I have a vagina and have met plenty of people from reddit without being murder-raped. 

But you should post this in /r/nycmeetups and watch the posts there to see if there are things you want to join in. scumbags and superstars 100 Clinton.Yeah a sign will do wonders. Most people will see it and walk away. 

Maybe even a sign that says this area is monitored or some shit. Take a shit in front.Most assholes will leave you alone if you just walk the other way. In those situations is best to just walk to the nearest large group of people. Just in case something actually happens, that increases the likelyhood of you getting several witnesses or even someone filming it So your plan is to avoid "ghetto looking" black men from now on? There's only two ways to handle confrontation, disengage immediately or crank shit up to eleven and commit to out crazying the crazy man.&gt; She responded, I told him something to the effect of “back the fuck off”

Just throwing gasoline on the fire.  Walk away and don't describe people as "slightly ghetto looking".  What the hell does that mean exactly? Assume everyone picking a fight with you is mentally ill and don't judge people by what they look like. Just leave it alone."Fuck you!", "I'd like to fuck you!", or "I'm going to fucking kill you!" ???Shit this is like a dream for me, pontificating on the history and merits of different Brooklyn neighborhoods? I'd be down, but it honestly seems like more of a time commitment than I'm interested in.They're obligated to fix that shit and you should stay on them about it. Yeah, having your employer move you to New York City is a major step backwards -- sorry for your bad luck, that sucks amiright? Not having to own a car and being able to walk everywhere is amazing.

As far as living costs, yes NYC is expensive. They should be paying you more than wherever they're moving you from to make up for it. If not, push for it/sorry you have a shitty job...What's your actual budget for housing? Or are you just shit-talking NYC because you don't know any better?Let me call you a wahhhhhmbulance. Don't shit on the city bc it is expensive. Shit on yourself for not doing proper research before putting NYC down as a possible match for your residency. You sound like someone very fucking unprepared. As hard as it is, let's leave your monumental stupidity to the side for a moment. How do you expect to treat patients when you're seething with resentment? You're the one standing between me and death and all you can think about is how much we all suck? Save some New Yorkers' lives and don't come here.you shouldn't switch lanes in the tunnel. tho i did see an asshole run over the flexible dividers to switch to the right lane in the midtown tunnel....
i've found myself in the same position as you, i make a right onto 39th St and then a right onto 9th Ave then make a left either 38th or 36th to the midtown tunnel. I like office jobs personally, but I also love my career so I might be biased. It's fun to have a social circle of people you spent the majority of your waking hours with, and I like the structure of corporate environments. I understand that this is considered unhip, but I really don't give a shit.This is just another reason I think AirBNB is doomed. It's just a bad idea for everyone involved. Stay at a hotel people, seriously. For the sake of your neighbors, don't do this shit to them.LL Beans Duck Boots. Just buy them to handle rain and snow. Classic shit that won't break the bank. 

Unless you're wearing crampons you'll never find something that gets complete traction on black ice, I also have north face chillkats, but they're honestly straight up ugly and I only wear them when the snow is fresh and deep. It's just a fact of life that you will eventually fuck your shit up on black ice.Do normal people post on a fucking internet message board before they try to speak to other people?

Jesus fucking christ.

No, just don't talk to anyone.  Ever.  Hotdog from a street vendor, i dont know I just expected good quality dogs the city over especially a stereotypical street vendory place. Nope just a shitty as any normal hot dog from any other citynew yorkers or transients? we new yorkers go hard for ALL our local chains, shitty or not. for example: many of us still miss Crazy Eddie's. I consider that a boring ass video.This is not a steal, but if it's big it's a good deal.  There's a lot of range in the phrase "two bedrooms".  C is cheaper than B, and I lived on 13th and B in a shite 2 br for $3,300.  It was shite, total shite, but it had 2 bedrooms and a living room.  

IF it's a shit two br then it's not a good deal.  If its a large great 2 br than it's a great deal.  3k for 2br on C could go either way.  

Pardon I just read "pretty massive living space".  Sounds like a good deal.I don't think there are any neighborhoods you can buy in for that low price with the amenities you want. You will likely have to rent like most people. Also, your comments about the city are straight up ignorant. You should never be buying somewhere that you obviously know so little about. 

And fuck the Seahwks. Is Bushwick safe? For the most part. Would I live in Bushwick? Fuck no. It is not a nice area, it can get desolated at night, it is very industrial and slowly getting gentrified. Quiet on a Friday night is hard. I would be looking on Yelp for high end cocktail bars and hope the price tag would keep the noise down, but I wouldn't expect actual quiet. 

Also, you don't have to generalize an entire gender because your friend sucks. Holy shit....I eat it at least weekly, if not more than once a week. Come on people, it's PIZZAThe fuck is wrong with you guys. Once a month? Every couple months? I know there's a lot of great food in New York but that's borderline treason.Pizza isn't even food. I get pizza on my way to go eat. I can't quantify that shit.She's probably not THE most hated celebrity here, but Taylor Swift being the NYC Tourism Ambassador and making dumb-ass videos explaining concepts like "bodegas" and "stoops" was godawful.I'm from England and I can't find a shitty late night kebab type place. It does not exist in New York.Easily the times square dos caminos. If you can serve me a margarita with a fucking habanero in it, you can listen to me say fuck out loud.&gt;I know I can easily fight this. . .

If you represent yourself you will have a fool for a client.

You need a criminal defense attorney of which there are many in the city.Their website sucks dick. I registered almost a year ago and it still isn't showing me as registered online. Call the board of elections of whatever borough you're in to check and see if you're registered.No we don't agree. MTA delivers the largest system in America, the only 24/7 system in America (one of only a handful in the world) at the cheapest price in America. I'm fine with the price. 

If the state wouldn't keep stealing money from the system, it would be fine. Talk to those corrupt fucks up in Albany. They don't. It's a stupid tradition. 

Just do cyber monday. AMNH has a giant gift shop with a whole wall of stuffed animals. 

Disappointing to see so many people directing you to Build-a-Bear.  People complain about the mallification of NYC and then support these stores?  Damn. The met is the met dude, I don't know if it matters in regards to you paper, but yea the fucking met.You are a bad person if you do that. Because people are lazy and selfish.Because once one person stands by the door instead of moving in, then everyone else gives up on being helpful because they already saw that one fucking asshole.It would appear that you are living above what we often refer to as a selfish dickhead.new people always seem to think the fire escape is some sort of porch, dont they. personally if someone was outside my window or near my window at 2am i would call 911 for a burglary. fuck thatRIP Pathmark. Fuck A&amp;P for running them into the ground. BJ's or Stop and Shop for me. Wish the Stop and Shop by me that was my Pathmark was torn down and rebuilt into a proper one, not this cover-up and profit shit they've done to the store.Popped out of my mom's womb, too lazy to leave.Everywhere else sucks more.Doing shit by yourself is the fucking best. NYC is pretty well documented in cinema for going solo. You just have to learn to not give a shit. It's normal. Maybe find a place with corkage and bring a bottle and kill the whole thing yourself. Read or play on your phone. If you find a place where you can sit at the bar it's also a good opportunity to make friends.


Happy Birthday :)

Apparently I'm too fucking old to hang with you. Try /r/nycmeetupsRockefeller ctr will be crowded. last election NBC had a huge event, but I've heard it's been toned down this election. Other than that it's not a big deal. We're still fuckedSchools are closed, so some of the kid friendly museums might be a bit more crowded than on a normal weekday. A lot of bars will be having election parties. You might see anti-Trump stuff all over.

Shouldn't be that big of a deal...Definitely won't affect your trip majorly. Unless you are walking around in a "Make America Great Again" hat. And if you are, fuck you anyway.Fuck that. Not worth it. The one on which somebody has shit their pantsStop spamming shithead.You might have better luck on /r/nycmeetups, which is geared toward social stuff and meeting people, than you will here, where we're mostly answering questions, not trying to hook up. Well, unless you're a certain asshole who has a stalker girlfriend. Fuck the people who think it is ok hard.  They are part of the problem.32nd floor. If it doesn't come to my door, it wouldn't be delivery. Its one of the reasons I do not understand the theory behind UberEats. What the fuck does the driver do with his car while bringing the food up to me?Yes! We moved here two weeks ago. Since then, my husband, daughter and I have all been sick. Like, exhausted in bed with massive head cold and cough sick. This city is amazing but it's kicked our ass so far. Lots of dogs, lots of rich people who don't like to clean shit. When I first moved to the city, I ran into this lady as I was leaving the Trade Fair. She was in front of my heading outside - brace arm cane things on each arm, struggling with handfuls of bags, sweet little old lady looking type. She turns around to me, hands me a handful of bags saying "here, hold this shit" while she produces a pack of cheapass off brand cigarettes and lights one. I offer to help her get her bags home and ever schlep them up to her walk up, where I am greeted by her insane dogs. When I get inside, the first thing she tells me is to never fucking do what I just did ever again and that that is the first lesson and I'm lucky she's not a fucking lunatic like her middle child, that asshole would probably have robbed me. The rest of her family had fled to Florida; she said she'd rather fucking die in the hands of the morons in Queens Mt Sinai than move to Florida. She drank ouzu like it was water. She showed me around the city, taught me a lot of curse words and insults, and became my drinking and smoking buddy for the better part of a decade before she passed away last year. 

http://www.chromeindustries.com/forged-rubber-dima-black-black-sneakerI got into the elevator at my old office building, and two young Asian women got on carrying frozen yogurt.  They pressed the button up to their floor at a securities trading firm, and they started to talk in the most bro-ish way possible with the thickest of Queens accents imaginable "I told him, no fucking way I'd finance it at that rate."  "Well that guy is a total douche anyway, fuck him." 

Totally surreal. I'd rather deal with dog poop than human poop. Fuck you if you're the scumbag who took a shit on the stairs connecting the L and NRQ at Union Square. Stunk up the entire L train platform. The LL will probably not care. The police definitely doesn't care. 311 can't do shit. 

Buy a noise machine - I recommend lectro fan from Amazon - or think about moving out if this is upsetting you too much. Meanwhile, keep trying to talk to this person. 

My landlord makes my damn apartment a fucking sauna. Moving is a bitch and costs $$$. Unless your basement apartment is cramping your style and comfort more than an extra roommate will, I'd stay put and save the money.Damn, a meetup a block from me and I'm not available at that time.I feel your pain. There is no thought of maybe others don't want to listen to your shitty shitty "music". These are the same people who get insulted that no one wants to live with them.Good fucking luck.No. If it was stolen USPS wouldn't have any idea, therefore they wouldn't know to update the delivery status. They have millions of packages to deal with. Shit's just lost is all, hopefully only temporarily.Punch them in the face or yell at them to shower /s

I mean honestly what else besides leaving the train car at the next stop can you do? Ummm, it's butt fucking everyone else when your friend doesn't pay his fare. If 1 unlimited could be used for 2 people, that'd be half as much money for the MTA. I personally don't want service cuts.&gt;You guys are so hateful. Wow. You guys have no logic in your statements. Just unnecessary hate. Smh. This is exactly why society is where it's at. 

No, this particular problem of society exists because assholes like you think they are above the law.  Theft of services is stealing exactly the same as theft of goods.  So fucking worth it. Every time I get in the car it's just a much more enhanced experience.Broker fee used to be 15% of the entire lease as a standard, but you should knock it down to equal to one month rent. Try to negotiate even lower if you can but one month rent is the new standard.

Security deposit is usually equal to one month rent. I had to deposit two months of rent at my first place when I moved here. Shit fucking sucks. The stock market skyrocketed in 2012 so I missed out by having that extra security deposit with my landlord.

So for a $2,000 apartment, I would have at least $6,000 ready to pay out for broker, security, and first month of rent. Or if you can set aside $8,000 then that would be safe.

Edit: you might be able to find a unit in a luxury building at that price, especially if you're ok with Queens, Brooklyn, or New Jersey. Luxury buildings generally don't have broker fees and often will give you a 13-month lease for only the cost of 12-months of rent (one month is free).I'm so confused, do you not know where your family lives? Is your grandmother expecting to wander around the streets until she bumps into him? Wtf?What the fuck, who picks a fight with a fucking retiree?I know then bc my wife lived in this house since she was a kid and most of the neighbors are still the save people. I'm friendly with some. 

When the people next door moved in last year my only interaction with them was to tell to never ever under any circumstance block my fucking driveway again. Lmfao what kind of question is this?! Nobody gives a shit that ur black. Stop and frisk is illegal in NYC, by the way. If you don't do anything illegal then what are you scared about?Ninja New York. They have magicians and shit.This guy fucksIf you had hi-chews I would buy. Fuck m&amp;m's and welches.If you're a good skater it's fucking awesome. Go anywhere you want, just don't get hit.Why is yellow a state color? The state flag has orange, in honor of the Dutch founders of the city. Get this yellow shit off my license plate and out of my faceAs fucked as any of the ten people who posted this same question in the last thirty days. I'm not a citibike user but it seems pretty freaking obvious that these guys don't dock easily and that you have to yank on them and verify they were systematically returned before running off. Hell no.

I did this a few years ago when I was 17-18. We were both natives but went anyway. We got shitfaced and went at night after waiting about 2 hours because the bus had broken down on the tour before.

The have staged set ups on the street that are so corny. Save your money for sure.

It was only okay because we were drunk and knew the most NYC trivia which helped us win more dumb shit.

Do your research via the side bar/us. Make a detailed list of shit you wanna see and like. It'll save you time and money.If there was a reliably cheaper way than the bus nobody would be stupid enough to sit on one through NYC and CT traffic in an uncomfortable seat next to someone talking on their phone for 4 hours.Last week I was at B&amp;H and made a pretty big purchase. At least to me. Like, around $4000. 

Two of the items were two hard drives valued at 57 each. When I got home  I realized one of the drives was specifically for Mac and was .99 more expensive than the other one. 

So I go in, hadn't even touched the seal  and ask for an exchange. This fucking guy gets me my hard drive and says "ok you're all set". So I ask for my damn .99 back. Same as you, I'd let it pass if it was a small business but this is B and fucking H. The dude kinda rolls his eyes and tells me "it's against policy but ok". Like he's doing me a fucking favor. The lady next to me was returning like 2k in products and I'm asking for an exchange of an item I purchased 4 hours ago and you're pissy you have to let go of 99 cents? 

Rant over. Fucking B&amp;H man.I don't want to be impolite but don't know how to state this otherwise. Did you ever consider maybe she needs to recognize herself and learn not to give a fuck about what others think? Stylizing and stuff like that is just covering the issue instead of holistic alleviation of the problem. Very strict. They inspect each card with more scrutiny than border patrol. My 28 year old friend, despite looking 28 and having a legitimate ID card from a foreign country, got tagged as an 18 year old and couldn't drink while we were there. There is no bribe big enough for them to risk losing their business over.

Edit: Holy shit they've sold Webster Hall!? Man. Well, forget what I said, I'm with /u/U2_is_gay - it's worth a shot for the last night. broadwayforbrokepeople.comhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/search?q=friends&amp;restrict_sr=onOffer up the boi pussy.The E and F are currently fucked in Queens, they aren't going past 71st continental on the weekends, and Manhattan bound trains are running like ass on weekdays due to construction.

So are you saying that the windows are so dirty that no light gets through?

&gt;So, I think technically I would have a case in court if I deducted it from rent.

Yeah....about that. If you go and deduct shit from your rent without landlord approval then you will have a bad time. Especially since you are not as technically right as you think you are.

&gt;Before someone says "just live with it". It's pretty damn disgusting inside those windows. ...

Then why the fuck did you rent the apartment?I left and lived in Boston and Las Vegas before I came back. Fuck living anywhere else. Just so you know, this is a really huge ask as you have to get there stupid early to be close enough to end up on TV. So many!

How I met your motherIIRC, /u/paratactical has listed a sample or two to people in the past.   

Mine would be - "Don't be a dick. Pay your shit on time."    

That's about it.  if you're thinking of starting a plant delivery service, sign me the fuck up. the only plant i have is a large (maybe 4') peace lily plant i got when my dad died last year (random side note: we got like 4 of these when he died. i had never heard of them before. is this a thing?? peace lilies for funerals/wakes?)

i was able to take it home in my car because of the circumstances (was out on LI with my car when the plant came into my possession) and i was very worried i would kill it. so far so good. 

now, i would legitimately put a tree in my apartment if i could afford it and transport it. i never realized how much i love having greenery in my living space until i got my current plant. Don't smoke. Just don't fucking smoke.  Clearly it's disturbing your neighbor, and it's fucking up your health. JUST...DON'T...FUCKING...SMOKE. Smoke is a bad smell. I don't see any ambiguity here. Like one of the other comments says, they don't need to explicitly ban shitting in the hallway.Most people nowadays go outside to smoke.  Bonus, your apt won't smell like shit.Can't keep a fucking plant alive for shit. I want to blame the lack of light in my apartment but who knows? Depends on the time, but yes, it still sucks.

You can still buy tickets this way and it is more reliable than say Craigslist the day before because at least if your ticket doesn't scan you have a better chance of finding the scammer and kicking his ass afterwards. I'd be suspicious if he offers an unreasonably low price and only has one or two tickets. Also a flag if he doesn't look like he's from the Bronx. Whereas the guy with the stack will stick around selling multiple sets well into the middle of the game and his face is likely well known in the area since he makes a living off this.Fuck ghost.

I wanna see the subway mole people.No one is downvoting you because they think you're going there. They're downvoting you because it's a stupid, lazy question without any details that make answering it interesting or worth someone's time and it's obvious it's homework. If you'd disclosed that it's part of homework, given us more details, and not been a moody shit over downvotes, you wouldn't have gotten them. You need to talk to your girl and find out what her plan covers. We can't answer this for you, it depends on her policy.

Why are you coming to us instead of asking the person who has the exact details of her insurance? And if she doesn't know, she can call her insurance company and ask them and know for sure instead of trusting assholes on reddit.

Especially taking subways and going to work. Im cold outside so I put a ton of clothes on and then step into a crowded subways and start sweating and then back outside into the cold.

Ugh. Winter here sucks.You could take the Septa to NJTransit. It's cheaper than Amtrak but the commute would really suck. Your landlord is paying for it, you said the exterminator was there a month ago. If you have holes in your apartment and filthy neighbors you are fucked. Plug the holes and get AdvionWhy would you use a knife in sex?  Try Paragon.  Lure is sexy.
Temple Bar is also sexy.
Zinc Bar is sexy and has jazz.

And I've always wanted to be fucked in Bemelmans' bathroom.I've used Creative Sign &amp; Awning, 55A Delancey.  Definitely on the affordable site because this shit gets expensive quick.No because this shit is really easy to filter yourself on literally any dating app. No. You or your friend are disrespectful and nobody wants to hear or see you fucking in our tax funded parks. "lol" fuck you. You ran into an asshole and they did something they thought would piss you off. Ignore it.Most likely Snapchat. I know many irritating people that "out" someone on Snapchat for being a "jerk". Pay no mind. I'm gonna skip subway stuff, because I think we've had fucking ten thousand threads on that, but:

* people in my building who just moved here from fucking wherever yokel hell hole think that the mailman is going to take back wrongly delivered mail or something. You have to write "RETURN TO SENDER" and drop it somewhere. Postal workers here don't pick up and if you weren't an abject moron, you'd know it because the pile in the lobby just grows and grows and grows.
* people who look at their phone while going up or down stairs. Fuck you. Fuck you all. You walk slow as all hell and there's never room to get around you while you plod like a damn buffalo. Wait until you're off the stairs and then do whatever stupid unimportant bullshit you're doing.
* using the flash on their phone to take pictures for their instagram in bars and restaurants. I don't care that you're the kind of loser who does this, but can you be the kind of loser that doesn't fuck the ambiance with your flash?
* pushing to the front of the sidewalk crowd at a busy intersection and not jay walking. Wait in the back if you're going to wait for the light to change. People who move into a new building or area and then complain about neighbors or businesses that have been there for years and expect the older tenants to change their habits to suit their petty needs.

Yeah, fuck off.Drivers that think they can take the walk signal with pedestrians in the crosswalk what the fuck is up with that.The main thing is of course being inconsiderate when travelling on mass transportation. Loud fucking music too. I don't mind city noise, but your shit music is not "city noise". Drivers:  I'd say it's the 75% of all people aged 16-45 that always drive like a xXx2FaSt2FuRiOuSxXX wannabe badass.  Constant speeding, weaving in and out of traffic, always trying to cut one car ahead, driving as far as possible in the merge lane, using the shoulder to cut people off, ignoring the long line of cars at a highway exit and trying to force their way in at the actual point of exit, turning the middle lane into a long, jammed exit lane because of the previous maneuver, blasting shitty music even in traffic, completely ignoring their turn signals--you're surrounded by 8.5 million fucking people perhaps give them a warning about which direction your going to swerve your 2000 lb. vehicle in, continuing to do any of the above while the NYPD is right there not giving a shit.  On the other hand, lots of drivers drive waaay below the speed limit because they're terrified of making a wrong turn (and ending up in a--gasp--"bad" neighborhood.)  Also, Jesusfuck, next time you're on the bus, look for how many people have a phone in their hand.  Absolutely disgusting.   Yellow taxis... are pretty decent, and in my experience have been much cheaper than an Uber every single time.  The private cabs with the plates T######C are a fucking nightmare.  Always driving slow, focused more on looking at the sidewalks for customers, always abruptly stopping.  Endless fucking honking at any person standing still.  I can have 25 cars honk at me during one cigarette break.  They're fucking everywhere now.  They have also been much more expensive than the yellow taxis every time.  

Shout out to the crossing guards, they that go stand in the middle of crosswalks and intersections to assist pedestrians with safe crossing--I'm sure without them, hundreds of more people would die every year.  NYC needs to shed 1 or 3 million people ASAP--this place has grown unbearable.  Being a senseless dick because they have it in their mind that being a "real new yorker" involves being a senseless and insufferable asshole Tomorrow, Saturday, House of Yes in Brooklyn is doing a costume market with a bunch of crazy burning-man style vendors. You will 1000% find sequin shit there. I think it starts at 2ish?* Talking nonstop about your startup in a bar at the top of your lungs.  We don't want to hear any more about your startup.  Enough.
* Standing right at the subway door entrance so nobody can get in or out.
* Entering the subway car while people are trying to exit it, I'm looking at you Grand St. station.
* Looking in a different direction than you're walking.
* Being an asshole while biking, being an asshole to someone on a bike.
* Biking the wrong direction.
* Speaking of bikes, why the fuck do you have to play music through a speaker while you're biking, you fixie hipster dipshit?  Ahem.


EDIT: I thought of more stuff...Smoking weed in public or anywhere where others can smell it

Riding bikes as though you don't have to yield to pedestrians and don't have to follow traffic rules

Drunk ass dudes who hit on women especially in the subway People who act incredibly affronted if you do something like bump them on the subway or step on the back of their shoe. It's a crowded city, I didn't do it on purpose, I said I was sorry, GET THE FUCK OVER ITFuck you if you don't clean your pet's piss and shit off of the sidewalk. Nothing conveys the message that you're full of shit faster than saying that you have nowhere to stay "due to being scammed... **lol**". People who have been scammed don't "**lol**" as they're usually fucking pissed.

Go back to wherever you came from and get your mind and life right.Just wanted to thank OP for giving a shit about other people and trying to not be a dick.  If only all new parents were this considerate.You moved somewhere without doing rudimentary research and now you want them to change? Fuck you. Even if I could, I wouldn't. Every car ride you take it contributing to the ridiculous traffic that's making our quality of life worse. If possible, I'd suck it up and take the subway. For every trip? Every trip? Shit, might as get a car then. What the buzzer/intercom situation is.  I can't tell you the amount of friends that I have who moved into a 5th-floor walkup only to find out that the buzzer is broken and has been broken for 5 years with no plans to fix.  That is a phenomenal pain in the ass.Those a crusties. Don't worry, they head back home to mommy and daddy once it gets cold oout.

Welcome to the city, stupid throwaway.Also- never engage crazy. Across the board. Crazy guy on train, don't make eye contact. Don't open the doors to them singling you out in whatever they are doing. If you are standing in a spot on a train and some crazy motherfucker comes up and stands next to you and starts yelling crazy shit, just non-chalantly move the fuck along. Go to another car if you have to. There's a lot of people on the street with mental illnesses unfortunately. You can really reason with that when they are in a fit of craziness. Drivers: Don't be a jerk.
Cyclists: Don't be a jerk.
Pedestrians: Don't be a jerk.I'll go to Miller's Ale House in Queens from time to time. The place is a total shit show, but I think that's why I kind of like it.Girl here. Happens a lot but it's never been scary. Back home (Argentina) it's a bigger issue and a dude's actually followed me to work while threatening me all because I told him to fuck off when he shouted something gross at me. 

I find that cat callers in NY do sorta chicken out when you call them out on their bs. They just pretend you're not there.&gt; looking for you to build our trip

oh shit get me the popcornI wouldn't make time to plan this bullshit. 
Happens so often in my neighborhood and I absolutely hate it. It's gotten to the point where I often yell at them to fuck off (if I feel safe enough to do so and it's not super late at night). When I respond with fuck off, etc they seem confused usually. Generally I have headphones in though &amp; I feel like I just always look pissed so that helps. 

In my opinion, it depends on the danger/risk factor though. I've been drunk before with other girls coming from Chelsea (not my neighborhood) and dudes hollered at us driving by in a car and then when one of my friends told him to go fuck himself we're not interested and he got so pissed that he said he would kill us or some shit &amp; it was genuinely pretty scary. It gets really weird and it can get dangerous anywhere, but in my experience it's typically just been annoying day to day and not usually scary. 

Honestly it really has me wondering if they've ever seen a fuckin ass or pair of tits before or a pretty face or any fuckin skin or 0 skin like wtf man we are just women trying to fuckin walk. Also, sometimes I ask them if they would want their mother/daughter/sister to be treated like a piece of meat too and then they get real confused and start pondering in silence.  Dont ride your bike on the sidewalk with pedestrians, If you cant ride on the street don't fucking ride a bike. What the fuck is this app.How the fuck do you expect someone to be able to tell you the speed to swipe your metrocard at? FFS. If you're here all fall, it will be below 50 a lot. Use Google Maps for subway directions, but give yourself a bit of extra time if it's vital that you be there on time. Far less dangerous than it ever was before, still a shitty and depressing place nobody would actively want to live inGet something that goes down below your butt, it's life changing! jesus fucking christ.There are barricades to prevent morons like you from doing this. You ride the F? Just yesterday the F/M was fucked around 9:30. Running express from W4 to 34th. 

Shortly afterward B/Q into Manhattan was fucked. 

Maybe you are just lucky this month. No, it's quite horrible. Nice-looking, smart, accomplished women with their shit together are a dime a dozen in NYC. The men will date you, fuck you, play with you, then back away when they've had enough. The day they're ready to commit and settle down, they'll pick a 25-year-old who thinks she's really mature for her age. 

If you move here, say goodbye to the idea of marrying and having children with a man your own age. What's the publication and  is the deadline tomorrow? Why are you asking us to do your job? I smell bullshit.

 You literally shotgun spammed the same template message to other cities' subs. 

Just tell them to fuck off, or call the cops, or both. Take down your resume. This is one the stupidest things you can do on Reddit.Congratulations!  Fuck that downstairs neighbor!I'd rather kill myself, thanks Hold a religious pamphlet or garbage bag full of cans and you can do this anywhere.

Watching SEC sports at any bar. If you need to cry, Citi Field.

NYSE trading floor if it was the 80s.

Just go to Barcade and lose your shit every time Frogger gets squished. $0.25/3 screams.As much as people shit on gothamist, i Find it to be a pretty good resourceYou are super screwed. You need a lawyer. Holy shit. Does nobody know about the search function???? Even if you'd bother to scroll half a page you would have found that this has been asked 4 times today.Fuck me sideways with a chainsaw!!!! Enough with the glassesFind your old roommate and kick his ass. Jk, don't do that.This is fucked up. If you have any evidence that you informed the landlord you would not be resigning the lease, you can probably counter sue. Bark at the moon. Freak out. Maybe shit myself.you just seem like a dick for getting so impatient with everyone and everything. that behavior is dickish anywhere in the USA, and probably in every other country as well. when someone does it to you, you'll understand.I hate you all. try not to spend more than 15 minutes in Times Square. it's a shithole. It was shite. I just burned my eyeballs out and now I have to use the narrator on windows. It also could just be that the broker sucks. My old place was great ( for a cheap walk up on upper east side). We moved out end of June and idiot broker had crappy pics up hat we’re actually another unit in building. It is still empty almost 2 months later. It’s a shame because my landlord is just a clueless old lady who doesn’t realize that a competent broker could have rented it the first weekend. Toronto has the diversity but not nearly the size.

Chicago has decent subways and feels american but it's way less diverse and more mid-western and again not as big.

Philly has more of a NYC vibe but feels small compared to NYC.

Boston feels incredibly different and feels like literally the size of one neighborhood.

No European city I know of has anything approaching the skyline, density, diversity, and straight up grime of NYC.

Plenty of Asian cities rival new york on size and density but all lack diversity, 24-7ness, and the general dynamics of bustling American metropolis.

I always say New York fucking sucks: it's dirty, expensive, the pay is low, the rent is high, the infrastructure is fucked up, the culture is shitty, the industry is non-existent, and it's pretentious and annoying as fuck. The only good thing about NYC is it's not any place else in the world which are clearly inferior.Hopefully cut off its roots so it can wither and die.You could do something arts-and-crafts-y, like making a photo album of all the tits you've been PMed.167th Street and Anderson ave Bronx,

Perfect for working out. Cops and FDNY do it here all the time.  Like 14 flights or somethings 

Have to walk up that shit every dayI always knew you were the romantic type, /u/-pm_me_your_tits_-&gt; I don't support the guy or anything

"I don't support him but I want to give him my money."

I'll go ahead and be the guy comparing it to buying one of Hitler's paintings because they kind of suck and it's "funny" to have.~14 or so

Brooklyn Marine Park

Was started because a black kid took my basketball and just started walking away, when I confronted him he sucker punched me in the face when I tried to get it back.

At that point I lost it, tackled him to the ground, then went to town on his face till it was bloody mess, eventually I got pulled off by one of the adults. 

No repercussions because this happened in the 90s, before everyone became a giant pussy.fucking thiefI mean, not since high school over some high school bull shit. I don't think too many people go to jail over school yard brawls The aroma of fresh urine with a hint of moist anus. Shitty marketing bots!A literal steaming pile of shit would be more revered than Donald Trump here.Probably found a shit ton of rodents or cockroaches in the kitchen/around food. That suck's. Especially since, according to you post history, the same thing happened to you again on the 20th. 2 phone's in 3 days. Wow. 

Seriously, what the crap is this? I can't even begin to understand your motivation with this horse shit storyThe only thing I hate is people stopping their cars on the driving lane, pitying emergency lights on and off load something, when they could park in front of a fire hydrant for the time being. Those people are asshole. I don't miss driving because I hate driving, but I do miss the autonomy that comes with having your own private vehicle take you door to door without the rigmarole of walking a few blocks to this or that train station and waiting 5 or 10 minutes for a 20 or 30 minute train ride.  Especially when it's raining or freezing or late at night when you're tired as hell and just Done With It.

So with that in mind, they might like an Uber gift card for those days when you're like "fuck it, I just want a car to take me there asap" which can be a godsend.  Things like making a doctors appointment or running late to meet a friend at the movies can be made 95% less of an ordeal with a private car to take you, obviously.I work in midtown east and I live in a tiny-ass apartment in Astoria with my husband who works two days a week and otherwise just deals with ASP, laundry, food, and planning D&amp;D sessions. Sometimes my commute is a goddamn nightmare, but my work is chill about when I show up and gives me cars home at night, so whatever, nbd. I would rather kill a bunch of wicked cute puppies and slit my throat than have children. I'm not going to sell you on my neighborhood and neither is anyone with any damn sense because the more wish-it-was-suburbia muthafuckas in a place, the shittier it gets. This question in here always amazes me.  There are *so many* people here, they are fucking *everywhere*.  In every store, on every street, in every bar, etc...Just be personable to enough people and you will make a friend or two in no time.  Unfortunately we live in one of the worst places for disc golf in the country. Cedar Beach out by Jones Beach Ampitheater might be the closest, but the course is small. Heckscher Park in East Islip is beautiful but a bitch to get to. It's a shame that Prospect or Central Park don't have a course, but there's just too many people and the real estate is too damn expensive.Fuck off, idiot. What a stupid fucking question. Did you actually finish high school? NIX has a ridiculous portobello carpaccio. Peacefood Cafe for their vegan quiche tart.I don't know, but I swear to god I once saw a show on one of those channels where a girl fucked a horse. It was terrible and nobody believes me.Buy a crap car. They aren't fake rolexes they're just shitty watches with fake bling on them and if they last more than 3 months you're lucky. No one will be fooled and you will look like a 15 year old that's trying too hard.Did you not make the turn improperly, and if so do you have video evidence of you not doing it? If you answered no to either of these questions you're shit out of luck.These dicks were barreling up Broadway last night too. Around 11:30 they were huffing and puffing for about 20 minutes straight.
It's probably legal or at least not explicitly illegal, I personally would find a different place to live because that's bullshit.Yes you do, especially if they're carrying your shit any distance whatsoever.6:45...Time to get your ass up and get moving.Yeah i think it's fucked up. If you can't find somewhere indoors such as your apartment i understand but try not to do it near kids. I see guys smoking up in the park 10 feet from the kids playground. Just do it in private like you have been. You stink the place up.
ur fucked buddy When he asks to see your penis, then he's gone too far.some fuckin people man...&gt; One guy had his thing priced at $12.99 per minute, which is the worst rate I've ever seen.

What are you going to report them for? Capitalism?

The guy you specifically cite in your story is a scumbag; and you did the right thing. So the answer is, yes.why are half of the comments on this post defending a fucking scammer lol   
you did the right thing   
unlicensed petty cab drivers are a common scam and will do exactly what happened to that family in your story   
i just wish the city could take a hard line on them... it's effortless to find them standing around central parkOP wants quality ingredients at cheap prices and is too lazy to do the research. Why be a dick on the internet to people you are asking help from? If your post replies didn't already give away the fact that you're an asshole, biking cheap sushi grade tuna around the city in the summer sure does...They fucked up. Sign that shit and send it back. Don't expect that to hold up in court though. You'll probably just get no increase. I’ll save the long winded response and just say: absolutely 0 reason to give a single f*ck about other people’s opinion in this case. Go play some games! (Conversely if you would like somebody to go with you I advise using the NYCmeetup subreddit)Nobody gives a shit about what you’re doing.

New Yorkers do things alone all the time.

Once you start doing things solo, you’ll wish you had started sooner.It definitely smells like shit but I also think you need to let go a bit. There are a lot of unpleasant smells in the city (every sewer grate in midtown in the summer, the piss sauna that is the subway, disgusting people eating in the train, etc.) and there isn’t shit we can do about it. It’s nothing new and it has been a part of this city as far as I can remember. 


I remember being very young in little league and wondering wtf the smell wafting from the handball courts was lol. It’s just one of those things people are gonna do, maybe with the popularity of vape and edibles you’ll smell it less in the future. I'd rather smell weed than have to dodge dog shit from lazy dog ownersLol is this an April fool's shit post?  Of course you have to take care of your own shit. 

This reads as "I'd really prefer to be a lazy sack of shit, that's ok cause I didn't pay a deposit so there's no real way for them to do anything, right guys?"My old landlord did this bogus shit to me. Paid me back in installments on top of that. Some people shouldn’t be landlords. Mission Chinese. Numbs and burns my whole face.I'll take the weed smell over the shit K2 smell any dayOh for fucks sake, dude, we leave your dumbass posts up all the time. it's "on" you moron.Are you stupid? Because you only ever post stupid shit.There are millions of people, some of them are very rude. Also in other places, some people are assholes. Call pest control you cheap ass! Do you think they're trying to scam you out of exterminator services? Or that they want their home filled with posion for fun?I’m ignorant as fuck about New York, I will tell people dead to their face that their state is inferior to my state. I’d rather be in Rochester than Richmond, fuck the world NY vs everybody.Continental. Frat boy bullshit.You’re at your wits end? How do you think your tenants feel living in a roach infested apartment with a landlord who won’t take the required action to fix the issue?   Sorry dude, but property management is a pain in the ass. Hire a property manager if you’re too lazy to deal with issues appropriately.    How has no one mentioned Joshua Tree. 

A fucking terrible bar in a worse neighborhood (Murray Hill)Been closed for a few years and I wanna say its spiritual successor closed down a year or two back, but Nevada Smith's was pretty shit. I'm glad they were on the balls of their ass being in debt and had the hammer dropping down.

I used to go there ages back with a fake to catch games when it's clientele still was a lot of grizzled, barely coherent, paunchy English assholes. Tolerable to an extent when you don't know any better and at the time there was so few soccer specific bars.

Then it got the full on ass end of the meatball dickhead bro crowd and basically the staff reacted more hostile and just were massive assholes to everyone. I was used to it being pretty low frills and hot garbage but the power tripping psychopaths that they got as bouncers and other staff probably made for one of the worst bar experiences I've ever had. They gave the degenerates at Continental a run for their money.

Heard some shit about North Korea too. I'll complain and talk shit about living in NY all day, but I'll be damned if I let somebody say that their state is better than NY.ITT: People shitting on my favorite spotsYou should just shit post on /r/asknyc. Just find sponsors for asking stupid questionsYea, you just got it shoved in your ass. Get a lawyer and see if you can fight it.Not to be a jerk, but this seems like an extremely googleable question.FWIW, I moved here from Sacramento for college and I thought similar things of "my small city sucks, NYC will solve my problems," which in hindsight was silly. NYC is great, but if you have your own problems in Seattle, there's a decent chance you'll have a lot of those problems only in a different place.  Also, I knew it was expensive going in, but it wasn't until I started living here where you really understand on a different level "oh shit, things are expensive and I'm poor" (my case, depends on your situation). 

That being said, I've been here for 3 years and I'm happy with where I'm at, so good luck. I did this unknowingly when I first moved into my place a few years ago. Except I recycle and don't do the dumb shit your neighbors are doing. I was just trying to keep the bags together since I thought that'd make sense for pickup, and they put their bags pretty much in the middle of our buildings anyway. They wrote a nice note asking us to put our trash in front of our building and not theirs so that's what I do now.&gt;BUT... They don't separate their recyclables from normal garbage, so I'm afraid that since their garbage can is in front of my house, the sanitation department might give ME a ticket instead of THEM.

That's why they're putting in front of your house. Is there a clear property line between your homes such as a driveway, fence or other demarcation? In all my 37 years in NYC I have never witnessed this kind of behaviour.

But we don't know if it's malicious or not do we?  If you are ticketed how do you prove otherwise? I'd start by writing a note and dropping it in their mail box. Make sure to inform them that it is the law to keep their trash in front of their home (http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/1908/trash-disposal-complaint). If that doesn't work, ring their bell. This is NYC, get in their face, not in a "I'll fuck you up way", but be up-front and don't hesitate to make your gripes known. Give an inch and people will take a mile. If they ignore you and continue, I'm sorry but you have an asshole infestation. Get a camera. Short of starting a war with your neighbor(s) the best you can do to protect yourself is to gather evidence and use it against them. Unless you get creative...You are a hilariously self centered person Ktown in Ktown is fucking awesome. Amazing, super cheap wings. Any bars a gay bar if you believe in yourself.....wait what?Like /u/PHC_Tech_Recruiter said, facebook. Well my friend's facebooks. I have a few that will forward weird art ones, or tech things. If you have any friends that do that stuff hit them up.

Also, I browse FEVER/EventBrite and Pulsd on some days. Thursdays and Mondays tend to have the best and legit openbars. 

I've been to some weird ones. And I've even paid tickets for some. 

The paid ones, tend to be worth it but require EFFORT and WORK to make them truly worth it.

Some tips I've picked up:

* ALWAYS Bring ones. (I frequently forget and feel like an asshole)
* Arrive early.
* Roll deep and discuss the best way to optimize the deal
* Calculate if the cost is worth it. How many drinks can you truly drink? Are 5 free drinks worth my sanity? How long is the open bar?
* Beer &gt; Mixed drinks. [They can't water down beer]
* Have a post-open bar plan
* Don't be a jack-ass to your bartenders Is your date that ugly?Is this an actual legitimate inquiry in that you're in the market for crazy fucking expensive penthouse? If so... "wow!" [voiced as Owen Wilson]. One of the butchers also sells dehydrated bones for dog treats and my dog loses his goddamn mind whenever we go by there because he knows his favorite bone is from that stand. Cross bronx pizzeria in the bronx. They sell fucking huuuuge slices and it tastes good too. Fuck all these other obvious suggestions...get yourself a New York slice at Sbarro.

Edit: But seriously, try a dollar slice at a couple places when you've hit all the other good stuff...just to compare. Meet me under Williamsburg Bridge in East River Park, I'm going to whoop your ass.Portland? Oh fuck no. One thing I've learned in looking for NYC apartments is that every broker is a scumbag whose objective is to screw you, no matter how nice they seem. Don't trust any of them.

Given that, tell him to piss off, and don't feel bad about it.

There's no reason to give him anything you don't need to, especially when you don't fully understand the possible repercussions.

EDIT: Additionally, just the fact that he's asked you to do something so dishonest is proof that he's a scumbag who you shouldn't trust.So, in life I’ve found that playing it straight is almost always the best option.  Here, the straight thing to do is to say that he’s your broker when he is your broker, and that he’s not when he’s not.  For buildings he didn’t show you, he’s not.  As others have said there are several ways this could bite you in the ass.  But even when you don’t know how something might bite you in the ass, it still might.  If you played it straight and were honest with everyone then (a) the odds of getting bit in the ass go way down, and (b) if shit does hit the fan you’re in a much better position.

And even if it doesn’t bite you in the ass, what’s the point of doing this?  To do this guy a solid?  Ok, but here’s the thing — he didn’t find you the place you ended up getting.  Being a broker is about results, and they get way overpaid when they do find something precisely because they get way underpaid when they don’t — they do work without getting paid when it doesn’t work out and then get well-compensated when it does work out.  This guy is trying to get two bites — he wants to get paid when he finds something, and paid when he doesn’t.  Why accept any risk at all for something like that?Don’t do it. Brokers in this city are the most lecherous unethical lazy parasites around. Wear your damn seatbelt people!It was a bad idea to take them down without permission. Put them back up. Even if you have rights that you could enforce to be allowed to use the not balcony, ending up in housing court over this would be really stupid.  The summer months have more units up for rent at a higher price because everybody moves then. Landlords try to get their apartments to turn over in the summer to get higher rents. It’s not just students or recent graduates or interns - it’s just the cycle the city is on. Partly because moving in the winter fucking sucks. I can usually be cool even with a lot of people not my type and have plenty of things roll off my back, but yeah living with that many people again  is a hard pass. I’ve   met very few people have it be fine and not be the worst shit. Even with friends it can be tough.

There’s always one or two people who turn the whole thing into a passive aggressive arms race and even the most minuscule  shit can get on your nerves and leave no room for civility. Dealing with 5 people’s lives in one place can be a pain, it’s too many lives to take into account when trying to live your life. Shit can be the worst when a person thinks, “oh there’s more people around, so that means I can be less responsible in my life”.

If it’s not someone’s outright attitude or approach, it’s background shit like the person who brought their pet being a terrible owner by not being around to let out their dog or clean cat box(s) and expect their roommates to be free walking services. Or someone who’s significant other basically becomes another roommate except they don’t pay for shit.

Oh and it’s always fun when this significant other is a total dumbass, doesn’t lock or close doors, leaves kettles on and just is an overall risk to your wellbeing with no confines to any agreement.

One of the roommates I had’s girlfriend and him broke up and she and a few friends trashed the place, stole all sorts of shit and broke plenty of other roommates’ stuff, going as far as taking a knife to a couch and bashing a guitar and TV. Walls and floors also had damage.

To make matters worse this roommate was the weirdo trustfunded shut-in who pretended to act like they didn’t speak much English the entire time to be avoidant of confrontation and various duties with things. You couldn’t imagine the frustration dealing with this level of bullshit. If anything it was the only time the majority of roommates were on the same page bound in fiery hatred against this one guy.



I get money being a driving factor for all this but idk even in the nicer, newer, relatively bigger spaces that seem like it won’t make it as bad, it can still lead to things being more trouble than its worth. 
Hip hop coming out of NYC. Now you got garbage like 6x9 (or whatever his name is) or mediocre rappers like cardi b. 

Are you kidding? I'd do it for free. There's a solid chance I'd catch the original cast of Sweeney Todd, get to see the early punk scene, etc. The opportunity to see so many things happening would be outstanding...and a little terrifying. 

The investment opportunity would be ridiculous, too. Throw some money into a recognizable tech stock (or Disney! holy shit!), figure out how to legally transfer it to future me, and wake up rich as fuck. 

Not doing the real estate thing because property taxes would fuck future me. &gt; beer pong (aka binge drinking)    

Only binge drinking if you suck at it. yep. sucks

i hate having cash on a metrocardNot a driver but I mute that shit as soon as I get in. Seconded! I've seen other city subs that have really toxic/condescending mentalities from locals treating the people asking questions like total idiots, so really happy to see how helpful and friendly everyone is here. Thanks everyone! :DEvery city becomes just another place to live, after a while. There are plenty of opportunities in NYC. It's just a matter on how much you work your ass off to get more of them.Creepy assholes. That's all. My coworker - who is a complete idiot - takes pictures of ugly ppl and he shares them on a whatsapp chat that has with his buddies. We are talking about a bunch of 40 years old men, making fun of what they consider ugly people. At the end of the week the one that took a pic of the ugliest person drinks for free. אחי כותבים jahrzeitIf this is really how you are being treated by people then holy shit you hang around terrible people. For some reason I really don’t believe people are treating you this way. 

Everyone I’ve met that does that holier than thou shit I ignore. Move on there’s millions waiting to be met. 

If you’re in your community and don’t feel ‘welcome’ don’t worry about it, that will come with time. i goddamn hate when bikers run red lights. glad there’s someone enforcing thisThey allow a shit ton of violations and still get A. Plus if the rating is below A, the restaurant can get time to remedy &amp; reinspect and post Grade Pending. 

So if a C is posted, they fucked the dog at least twice with at least 2 different inspectors AND could not manage to fix it. Incompetent or straight don’t give a fuck. Nah dawg. Old one: Tourist from Midwest is walking up Madison Avenue and asks a New Yorker, "Can you tell me where the Empire State Building is or should I just go fuck myself?"Not being patient with people who are obviously wrong.

"You're acting like a huge asshole."    
"Why should that matter? I'm right."I curse like a sailor, I don't have time for your bullshit, I hate tourists who are touristy, I always look down, I walk fast, I wear all black, I make really good pizza, I have strong opinions about most food, I've memorized the subway map, I get lost when the streets aren't numbered or lettered, I'll call you horrible things and buy you a beer in the same breath, did I mention I don't have time for your shit?  I say fuck a lot.[NON-NATIVE] I realized I had fallen into a NYC trope when I started going around tourists aggressively with the intent to make them realize they’re in the way. I was an AP holder at Disneyland and dealt with tourists stopping in walkways but just aggravated me and I didn’t try to make it known they were being morons. Then I moved here.I hate everyone.Moved here last fall. Not so much a stereotype as funny habits I realized:

I check my “blindspots” when weaving through the sidewalk.

I don’t so much as look over or up from my phone or give it a second thought when a cab or other car tries to pull through the crosswalk when I have the right of way. (It took me a bit to not hesitate and reflexively stop walking, letting them by.)


But, when I really realized i had transformed, it was at Trader Joe’s a couple weeks ago. I’m from the south and like to avoid confrontation. I was riding up the escalator with my cart riding in the cart escalator next to me. Someone got off the escalator a bit before me but started to dawdle, looking at fruit or some shit, right at the cart escalator exit. I realized the impending back up, but hesitated, preferring to avoid the confrontation. Well, when my cart arrived at the top and was shoved by the escalator into the two people’s carts dawdling in front of me, they turned around and shot a look, exclaiming, “Reallly?!”

Me: “It’s a fucking escalator! It literally stops for fucking no one. Why don’t you keep a move on and quit holding everyone up?!”

They quickly realized their error and sheepishly moved along. Tell assholes that are blocking the subway door that people are getting off. Get annoyed by people who lean against subway poles. Tell tourists to swipe their metro cards faster. Jaywalk. 
I can feel my blood pressure rising when I have to manuver around slow tourists or school kids staring at thier damn phones in the middle of the sidewalk. Someone called me an impatient bitch for "cutting her off in line" up the subway station stairs. I told her to go back to Florida so I guess I'm mean.- Fast walker
- Only fucks with bagels and pizza in NYC
- Always get into arguments about which borough is the best and what is upstate
This place is a disgusting shit hole, full of assholes, vagrants and scum but if YOU fuckin dare insult it, fuck you!Take a video, have someone else alert the conductor to call the police (every L-train car has a call button to reach the conductor). This is really fucked up that no one got the cops involved. If someone thinks its fine go beat their kid on a crowded train, imagine what kind of hell that kid catches at home behind closed doors when the mom knows no one else is around to step in. A citizen on the train telling her to cut it out isnt a substitute for real intervention from CPS. You're a dick if don't move up cause someone will honk at you and you're a dick if you block the box. Wasn't the tax bill a 2018 Tax Bill, thus not affecting this year's taxes? (And yes, I think Trump and the Republicans in Congress are assholes and that the tax reform bill was a huge load of horseshit--but smells worse). 


If I'm wrong, I'd actually appreciate someone to explain it to me, and how it affects this year's taxes. (And I actually do want information about it....I just don't know how to come off as not sarcastic, because I'm a NYer). I got a bigger refund than normal. Recent tax reforms don't effect filings based on 2017 taxes, so take your political bullshit elsewhere.I honestly almost never have that experience.  The overwhelming majority of my exchanges between myself and service/checkout/whatever people are usually pretty pleasant.  FWIW I'm a tall youngish white guy who smiles a lot if that makes a difference (I think it can/does). 

If I found that people were really rude to me constantly, though, I'd at least give some thought to the saying 'If you meet an asshole in the morning, you met an asshole in the morning.  If you meet assholes all day...you're the asshole.'Sad. Sticky traps are a terrible way to die.

Also you should grow up and stop being a lil bitch Nobody gives a fuckThe Booby Trap in Bushwick. Theme? BOOBS.L'albero dei gelati in Park Slope. Fucking delicious.I usually just make angry posts on /r/asknyc asking stupid questions. ERVS. ERVS. ERVS. ERVS. FUCKING GO TO ERVS. 

Best drinks in the city (especially now that Suffolk Arms appears to be closed) and last time I went, I paid ~$10 a drink, which is dirt cheap by NY standards. You’re at best insufferable. You write like the stick up your ass is a Rhodes scholar.&gt; How exactly do you handle the rude people of your city?

By not being an insufferable fucking moron and not having to experience it in the first place.I think Jennifer leather and Jennifer convertibles are shit. Honestly, poor quality materials and they bait and switch you—what’s comfortable at the store will never be broken in enough to sit comfortably before it wears apart. 

If you’ve got the money, american leather makes incredible sleeper sofas. Fucking assholes, for the most part. As a bike commuter, I think those videos too often show absolute assholes — because they’re riding in ways that endanger pedestrians and disrupt traffic.  If you’re into doing thrilling things, go bungee jumping — and if the cord breaks and you die, hey, you only killed yourself.  Sucks, but at least you didn’t take anyone with you.  But riding in a way where you endanger other people means you’re putting *them* in danger for your thrills — and that’s fundamentally evil.  So the riders in these videos should go get fucked until they learn to ride better.

As to bike messengers more generally?  Many of them are ok — the one time they aren’t is when they’re trying to get through midtown at lunch where pedestrians are everywhere, and the messengers don’t want to respect the lights, but I don’t think they generally engage in the type of assholery that you see in the videos."Trying to spread CheatDeathNYC ideology around the world because I'm sick of people not giving a shit about cyclists or our lives. "

So in order to try to make people care about cyclists, he's sharing a video with incredibly reckless biking that endangers himself and others, as well as violates a bunch of laws?  BOND REALTY. Never use these fucks

Saw a 2 BR for 2k in the UES they posted. Called the agent asked if its available. He says yes and to meet him at his office. I ask if we can meet at the apt (as every other realtor i worked with has done that) He says no so whatever I meet at his office

They sit me down and try to do a full consultation on me. Asking my salary, hometown, how many bedrooms, etc. 

I say dude I thought we were going to check out that apt, is it still available? He says "what apartment?" I go the one that I'm here to check out that I called you about 3 times. He says it's not available

They go on to show me apartments that are either not in the UES, or out of my price range. I told them I had to be in queens soon and asked when we were gonna go look at places? They said in an hour or two. I immediately left after hearing that. 

Those guys fucking suck It might be exciting, but these people are jackasses and I can only hope they injure themselves before they injure someone else. perhaps shitty generalization, but there's two professions I never swipe right on for bumble... real estate &amp; entrepreneur.Texas Chicken or Popeye's. Crown or Kennedy if you're near one.  None of that fancy bullshit. 100% happens in NYC. I remember a particularly bad experience where I wouldn’t f*** this guy, and he said truly horrible things to me. 
It happens a lot. From not wanting to make eye contact, to not wanting to sleep with them. I like Ruth Chris as a chain steakhouse but have never been to Del Frisco's.  Whoever said Uncle Jack's is off their fucking rocker.  That place is terrible.Specifically for dog owners, curb your dogs.

Dog piss on sidewalks is just gross. Not sure how it's tolerated. At least shit can be picked up for the most part. wait for people to get off the train before you start piling in. i'm about a planck's length away from assaulting the next person who walks into me with that stupid blank expression as i try to get off the train, in order to make more room *for them to get on.*  Me leaving the train helps you, how can you not just fucking wait ten seconds?

edit: since I'm already ranting like a madman about subway etiquette, unless your hands are already full or you are in some way debilitated, take your fucking bag off before getting on a crowded train. Give everyone a little more room to breathe, *please.*eat all rats.You didn’t. Stop being over dramatic. Tons of bars  (and ass since that seems to be a worry) up by Columbia. 

And as others noted, 30 minutes ain’t shit. The fuck is wrong with people?wow, chill. just take the subway. 

also, dafuq you thinking about with this? don't you have a job to do or some shit to learn? there are bars literally everywhere in the world. don't waste your youth on bullshit. you'll find plenty of fun. concentrate on actually learning something, that's the hard part. https://www.metmuseum.org/visit/audio-guideKarczma is my favorite Polish restaurant yet.  Go at off hours if you can (late lunch/early dinner) and get a beer, a schnitzel and extra pickles.  Holy shit.Also - People who try to get into the train before anyone has gotten off, why do you do this? Are you dumb or just impatient? I don’t mind it other then you being the first buzzer for packages and con ed- they will literally buzz until you wake your ass up at 7:45amStep all the way into the train.  So fucking annoying to have to squeeze in on when there is plenty of space in the middle of the car to stand in.

I usually just make angry posts on /r/asknyc asking stupid questions. the fuck are you talking about. Are there still gangs in NYC? MS-13 is in the news a lot lately but they seem to be more active on Long Island than in the city. 

((squints)) Can't tell if troll or just ignorant and tone-deaf.Do you post the diploma of the stick that resides in your ass on your apartment wall or in your actual large intestine.Lol @ this fucking herbWinter is long, very long. It's exciting through the holiday season. Then after that it's tolerable through mid Feb. Then you just get pissed off when March is a complete shit show. And you pretend April is spring, when it's really just winter making its final rounds.

So yeah, be prepared. Winter is bad. "Fuck you"baconeggncheese"It's a sidewalk, not a 'side stand around with your dick in your hand.''Fuck outta here.
deadass"Git da fuck outta here""Stand clear of the close doors you whores"deadassWhaddafuckDidn't realize it was specific to this area, but if you say, "Not for nothing" outside of NYC most people have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. on a really cold day - 


"it's fucking BRICK"


Something about it just perfectly captures those days when you feel the cold in your bones.yeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrYeh, yeh, yeh... "I'm just breaking your balls."Go fuck yourself

D'jeet?“This Fuckin guy”deadassCdvd? Fuckyshucky?Don’t make eye contact with me while we’re having sex; I don’t fuckin know you. Earlier this week I saw two people run into each other on the street who obviously hadn't seen each other in a long time. On sight, before embracing, one of the two exclaimed, "GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!"

It was a beautiful NYC moment. No, "calling out" a potentially mentally ill person that's already being confrontational is idiotic imo.


Defending an innocent person on the train is admirable, but I think that should only be a rare option for when things get bad.This is a bad idea. I understand how annoying these people are, but the “showtime kids” are ass holes who’ve beat people up before and the other people are mentally unstable and capable of anything. Best to just protect your safety and ignore them until they go away You guys should form a Reddit posse and fuck up people who harass innocent people on the train. Yep! Those subway dancers had the NERVE to actually ask me directly for money after thier annoying show, so I said "nah, dancing on poles for cash is only for bitches." To which he replied "fuck you!!" and I go, "coincidentally, that's only for bitches too."
I barely tolerate these fucks on the regular, but to hit me up individually is some ol bullshit.Fuck, I always miss the harmless weird shit.I don't tip until I get my shit back.NYC sucks. Everywhere else sucks more. How about the city buses that say "Please do not stand in front of the door" or something like that. You would think that people may realize that the bus was talking to them. I always want to say the bus is talking to you idiot yeah youre the one standing in the doorway. any gay novelty store in chelsea, i'd betI hate that fuk who backs up the taxi un the middle of the night taking a half an hour to parallel parkIn my experience, crazy bus people are crazier than crazy subway people.Take them down canal street off 6th ave I’d say and keep heading east down Canal, you’ll find a plethora of vendors. When it comes to negotiating haggle your asses off. Seriously. They’re looking to get as much as they can, don’t let them.Probably because it sucks ass. Sorry to sound incredulous, but you can deal with a single room, dorm style bathrooms, roaches, and what frankly sounds like incredibly shit living conditions but you couldn’t deal with a 40 minute subway commute from, say queens? To me your quality of life sounds atrocious and the trade off of a commute for a real apartment seems like a no brainer.How the hell did you manage to live in these conditions for ~~5 years~~ 6 months? Why don't you just move out of Manhattan. I'm still not sure why you transplants intentionally move to the most expensive neighborhoods in the city and then complain about why the rent is so expensive and the conditions are so shitty.You feel petty and spoiled because you are petty and spoiled.I got three beers and a half full bag of Doritos 

See you in hell fuckers!The people that ride their bikes on the sidewalk drive me INSANE! This isn't a damn freeway!!!New York City is going to eat you and your emergency fund fucking alive....  . BUT Ideally you want 6month of living expenses (aka rent/utilities/food fund)  


New ppl get hook on the nightlife and summer brunch of the magical city that is NYC. Enjoy it but spent wisely You have no fucking idea what you are talking about when you even suggest to stay at a homeless shelter. You need a *oral* surgeon.  Better to delete and re-post.ur gonna die bro sorry. RIP.Fuck out of here with you're piss poor excuse for guerrilla marketing. And take off your massive fucking backpack...I'm talking to you middle and high school kids.  I went to a private all girls. The demographics have shifted a bunch. Used to be like 54% White, 45% Spanish and Black, 1% Asian. It's now like 72% Asian.

It's also 500% bougier than before. Student laptops/iPads. State of the art labs n' shit. An extended wing. 

They get all this money, yet they keep asking my broke ass for donations. smh. Yeah I tried (mine was the day of) and they basically said "Fuck u" misspelled and all.Technically 1 hour but nobody gives a shit if you leave for 2-3 on a not-busy day. They are dirty.
I wipe 'em off with my shirt or rinse them.

My dad taught me they were dirty when I was a kid. We were sitting in the car, and was like, "Hey /u/rave-light, look at that guy standing on a palette of cans while stocking. That's the can you're gonna drink out of so wipe that shit up."

I always see people stepping on them at supermarkets plus rat shit/dust. I've lived in NYC all my life and I would put myself in the 90% of street smarts and I've fell for the "need money for taxi" scam when I was a bit younger. A few months later read in the news he got busted for buying heroine. I may have funded his drug habit for a brief moment but I'd like to think I helped get his ass in jail, too.Mine soaked the dish sponge in pure, undiluted bleach and didn't rinse it afterward, just put it back on the sink edge, so the next morning when I went to wash off a spoon (because all the spoons were always fucking dirty), it was coated in bleach, which doesn't mix well with yogurt, fyi.Walked. Fucking asshole always walking aroundI once had a roommate threaten to "hunt me down and kill me" if I sued him for my security deposit back because he was an illegal alien and feared he'd be deported and would "have nothing left to lose". I went to high school with him and all my friends are still friends with him, and they refuse to pick a side. It sucks balls.Watched from five feet away for five minutes as someone cut through all three of the U-locks securing my bike to our apartment's bike racks. He did not take a single picture or video, didn't call the police, nothing. This was during the afternoon in broad daylight. Apparently he was in shock because the loud sawing woke him up from his afternoon nap. I also had to interrogate him to admit the ethnicity of the thief, as if I was being racist or something by trying to get a description of the fucker that just stole my bike. So my roommate in NY didn't have a day job, but he made a ton of money elsewhere, mainly thru illegal bookkeeping I believe. He was a decent looking guy, combined with a very comfortable payroll, and would date several dime pieces a week. Like incredibly hot women, even for NY standards, and would definitely drop hundreds if not thousands a night on them. He'd also bring the party back to our place, mostly on weekdays, which would be annoying for me, as I had a day job, but I digress.

One standout story was on a weeknight, when he brought back a date, and I wake up around 6am to find him and his hot date standing by my bed, him apologetically asking if his date can smoke some of my weed (I've lectured him before about keeping it down on weekdays, and I hate being woken up). The girl said she would flash me her tits if I gave her some. Being groggy and grumpy, I just told em to grab some from my desk, and not to bother with the flash. 

Fast forward to later that day when I came home early from work because I had a flight to catch, I hear them in the bathroom, she's crying and sobbing and swearing at him while he's apologizing profusely. I had no idea what was going on, but tiptoed into my room, and kept hearing random sentences like "it hurts so much" and "I'm bleeding from my asshole!". Turns out, as you've probably guessed, that he tried forcing it in her ass, without asking her... This is just one of many stories from him, crazy ass character https://www.wnyc.org/story/chinese-robocalls-bombarding-new-york-are-part-international-phone-scam/I gave her a rent check. She comes back crying saying someone stole it. No problem, I can write another, but let me check first and make sure it wasn’t deposited because she’s kind of a dumbass. It was. She insists up and down she didn’t deposit it and it’s not in her account, someone clearly forged her signature and deposited it somewhere else. I have to take the day off work to file a police report and trace who deposited the check. 

It was her. If your plan is to stay in a homeless shelter until you find housing, that's a bad fucking plan.I usually don't comment on these sort of threads, but I had to here because you sound super naive and if you are as naive as you sound, you will get eaten alive in NYC.  I respect the enthusiasm and the wanting for bettering your life, but if I were in your situation, I'd go to another much cheaper big city, gain some employable skills/go to school, save up a lot more money, then get hired at a job in NYC if that's really where you want to end. 
Your plan would be feasible if you had like 10K saved up in a bank and a cheap safe place you could rent with roommates so you could spend your time actually finding a job/school. But trying to do all that while essentially homeless and nearly broke? What the fuck are you thinking.No one should ever move to a new city *planning* on being homeless. Save up more money first. You can wait. There's a difference between taking a risk and being plain stupid.Yeah, you may want to choose a different hotel. Nothing in Astoria/Long Island City or half of Brooklyn in your price range? Jamaica is a pain in the ass and way out there, and not exactly the best neighborhood, especially not for first time tourists.Don't have a solution for you, but this was happening in my building recently. I always have packages shipped to work, but accidentally had a bottle of probiotics sent to my apartment.

When I got home, the package had clearly been opened and lazily re-sealed with clear packing tape (it was Amazon so had that branded paper tape cut open, and a small box so they def thought it was electronics or something). I had to laugh like, "Sorry all I got was poop pills, motherfucker."

They were triple safety-sealed so I wasn't worried about tampering.Outback mothafuckin steakhouse How the fuck should we knowI’ve noticed taxi and Uber drivers don’t give a flying fuck about road manners. I don’t know if NYC has laws but if they copied some European countries we would have enough revenue from fines to fix the MTA and make it look like a Trump property.There is no option that will soundproof the kind of arrangement you're describing. At most you can create the vague illusion of privacy by hanging a heavy curtain.  You simply share a room with someone, accept it. Work out mutually agreeable rules for how to use your shared room for fucking, and go from there.It’s NYC.  The whole city is gay friendly.  Nobody cares if you’re gay lol. Take the kid to the playground, take the kid to the store, take the kid to the playground, take the kid to get coffee, put the kid to bed, watch tv, sleep.  Toddlers are wonderful, but fuck me are they exhausting.Abiko curry (in k-town) hit the spot for me, even if it's Korean-owned. I ordered a medium spicy curry and it was no joke for spiciness, I would probably go mild next time even if it makes me feel like I punked out. Attempt to murder my liver and forget why I hate myself.Consult a housing attorney or see if your landlord will pay for a gym membership for you to shower. I get that it sucks, but sometimes it takes time to get parts.Go to a park or the highline to read, alone, bc im a loser.Serve privlidged dipshits bottomless brunch then drink my fury away About fucking half.I can make a long ass list of all 'WTF somebody's gonna die' hazards in this city. This is one of them. The really really narrow platforms really boggle my mind. This is 2018. But it's also NYC. Everything is old and nobody wants to pay for shit.jerk off and methI feel like if there’s any day that you’d get shit for it, it would be July fourth.I’ve done it, and the downside is that sometimes once you’ve gone to the trouble of going up you just don’t want to go down again.  So if you come home for work and think you might want to go grab a burger... but, fuck, you just walked up all those stairs... the saltines in your cabinet look really nice.  

But honestly it won’t kill you — and laundry can be delivered.  And it’s good for your cardiovascular health.  The best way is to ignore it. Quizzical "what the fuck are you doing?" stare is also an option. Don't engage, they want your attention and you have better things to spend your attention onNo one has mentioned that there are a *shit-ton* of cops, with major grow coming post-9/11. It's not that bad. You get used to it. Your ass will look great. you didn't do anything wrong. your landlord is an asshole who is probably struggling to pay a much-too-expensive mortgage on the building. just move on. if they try to retaliate seek qualified legal advice. 

your landlord can't legally try to claw back the fees they paid to the broker. that was their mistake. the only thing they might realistically try to give you a hard time about is returning your deposit. however, that is your money and it is illegal for the landlord to fuck with it. again, if it becomes an issue seek qualified legal advice. Just fucking wing it. It’s NYC. Stay where ever the fuck you want and figure it out.This has been asked and answered thousands of times. 


Don’t waste our time with vague shit.  If you have a worthwhile specific question then by all means ask away otherwise do some basic research.I want the [Kate Spade taxi shoes](https://www.katespade.com/products/go-taxi-flats/S159103TX.html) but I’d feel like an idiot walking around in themOut of all places you could choose to ask this question, this place is one of the dumbest.u/nypd you might want to have more police patrolling the park. There are horny teens trying to fuck.Send those idiots the fucking crime map and stats, and compare to the national average.I’m an LPN. Currently in school for RN. I only went to school to get a pay upgrade and then to gtfo of NYC. 
People are rude, you’re over worked, under paid, and you have to keep saving your ass because god knows when a supervisor or aide would throw you under the bus. 

Long Island is still much better from what nurses there have told me. Other states pay much more and the working environment is more friendly and less stressfulI don’t even notice them, I much prefer that to those fucking bird scooters in every other city.Some idiot was on the tracks.I always ride with the idea that everyone (drivers, pedestrians, even other cyclists) around me is going to do the stupidest possible thing at the worst possible time. I then take steps proactively to prevent myself from dying as a result of that stupid thing. It's worked well so far.Fuck, I was going to suggest Ave Q, but it closed last week ;(Holy crap you guys are paying a lot. 2BR apt move in 6 hrs. Cost $550 after tip.NYC has lots of psychiatrists because we’re all miserable or crazy. Find one that specializes in ADHD.Who gives a shit. If you wanna do it, do it.Who cares. Just fuckin ask.A lot of people go the gym, my lazy ass cannot get up at 5 or 6AMIf you are young and shitty tipper, you gotta walk downThey always walk up to my apartment door but I do live on the second floor so it’s not hard for them. Except dominos; fuck those guys. I rarely order from them; they never come up.Do you want someone's bare ass on your couch?Dead as shit after a certain hour and given the high concentration of a lot of taller buildings and the narrower streets, it's not out of the realm of possibility to have multiple sides  of a building's apartments be in the shadow of a building for a good portion of the day not getting much sunlight. I've had friends live down there and even in the dead of summer it would be pretty damn dark(and a little depressing) starting at like 4-5pm-ish, and it was a big contributing factor to them bailing on a different place. 


Grocery store options kind of suck shit and there's been chatter of "a Whole Foods/Trader Joe's , other non shitty chain is *definitely* coming"  to the east part/seaport side for literal ages. 

Going back to deadness, while it's not the absolute worst shit walking up to parts of Chinatown or LES(depending where you're at) , you might be in the scenario of having to be the one going out to hang with people and never really having that super of a local neighborhood mix or big draws for friends to come hang.

I'd say it's probably not the worst of options if you're one to enjoy some quiet and like the connectivity of the Fulton stops.The problem with minimum wage work is the full time shit . They rarely give it out. You would be scraping  your teeth on a full time minimum wage forget about part time . 

Sure bring your car , but expect 200$+ in insurance. 

Maybe bring the car and sell it . It really is a fucking headache driving around for 30’min+ looking for a spot to only park illegally anyways and get a ticket . 

Um everyone raves about Astoria but to me it’s still very much a family neighborhood . If you want to not travel far and party Brooklyn would be the best bet . 

You want to do “creative” work , which I’m not entirely sure what that even means . Do you have skills for that? Do you have skills in anything job related ? 

Also ive said it before and so has other people , come visit and hop on a train to mid town at 6am/7am. Feel the commute . That’s nyc at its most get the fuck out of my way rush rush million people around you . I’ve lived here my whole life and it still blows having to fuck with that so early . 

But you’re only 22yo. So you can come have this experience . Just don’t get stuck . Don’t be 35yo with roommates working at Starbucks hoping that creative career takes off .  Good luck .How you make 130k per year but still have the ability to ask stupid questions like this? Is this you trying to flex cause no one is impressed. You should know if it’s “crazy or not”.I actually had to stop trying to fuck my coworkers once I became their manager.New York is fucking magical. I wish that everyone in the world could have a chance to live here (comfortably) at some point in their lives. 

It’s a microcosm of the whole world. You can meet people who speak any language and eat any cuisine, usually at any time of day or night. 

Your babies can take music classes with legitimate broadway musicians (like mine does!) and see Julliard graduates perform in jazz trios in Washington Square Park. 

I can get myself from here to there generally pretty easily via public transit. We can all bitch about the MTA, but as a driver from Los Angeles, I’m still always in awe of the subway. 

Any hobby, every hobby, every niche and subculture and weird ass shit that you’re into has a fan club here. 

It will take awhile to settle in and the people you spend time with make a big difference. Over time, there’s something for everyone and if you let it - there’s something here for you.I just saw that Buffalo Boss here in downtown Brooklyn is now selling “impossible” wings. I’ve had their hottest full-flavor meat wings and while not the hottest I’ve had they put up a good fight.

Other than that, if I was trying to avoid digestive issues I’d stay far away from food challenges like chowing down the spiciest wings. Good luck!Haha are you new here? Have you seen the shit people bring on the train? You'll be fineWhat the fuck is a Soul Coughing?I don't know much, but fuck Gristedes.lots of people do this, it's one of the reasons rent is so fucking highhttp://www.freemics.com/1. yes.
2. no. unless you're an asshole and back into people and hit people and stuff.Driving one block is ridiculousWhat happens after you check into your hotel that you don't have time?  Tell whomever you have a commitment to to cool their jets, you have to get some motherfucking noodles, and they can wait an hour while you get your food.Smorgasburg. Fuck that noise.Nope and I’d like to keep it that way. I’m not a misanthrope, I’d just rather decompress by myself when I get home and all my social energy for the day is already depleted from work bullshit.1. Your building will have a garbage area. It might be a chute or a room or an alley way type space. Your super will move it to the curb. 
2. Stuff doesn’t come to your door. It goes to the vestibule if you don’t have services or to the mailroom/front desk if you do. 
3. There is generally not mail pick up in buildings. You will have to take it to a box or store. 
4. Hire someone to unload and have them meet you. They can park/handle your shit at far lower expense.Union Square station. People walk too damn fast. I'm a quick walker myself, but the insane pace of everyone in that winding cave stresses me the fuck out.I know my next doir neighbors have loud as hell sex but don’t even know their namesLower the sirens on those damn mount sinai ambulances.Instead of "partying it up" in New York. How about you focus on your education. Wanna go to school here? Then take out loans yourself instead of making your parents pay for you to party for 4 years.

Act like an adult instead of referring to people as slutsMandatory lessons on spatial awareness. Have that shit stamped on your ID.AIR CONDITION SUBWAY PLATFORMS or at least a goddamn fan for fuck’s sakeNot to be a dick, but if you contact the exterminator to ask how you’d make their job easier, there’s a better chance they will do the best jobI've done that trip a couple of times. You see some weird shit. Take the car service.I got fucked once. I tried to take the A to Howard Beach but it only ran to 88th street. I was pissed. I had to take an Uber for the rest of the way. 

Be prepared for tons of trains going to Lefferts Blvd. It seems like all the trains go there at that hour. Just take a car service or an Uber.You can work on campus without issue.

That budget is more than enough for rent with roomates. You can live bike distance from Columbia for ~$1,000 for a bedroom

Dont use shitty titles on redditSaying, “I could NEVER live here!” is pretty fucking rude. I wouldn’t say that to you about your bumblefuck town, so don’t say it to me about where I live.This is all anecdotal. I have been living in NYC for 5 years now and have hardly been bothered, except in a few weird instances. I also spend a lot of time in neighborhoods like the South Bronx, Crown Heights, and East Harlem, where crime still happens. 

I have actually been jumped or mugged more times in smaller cities like Syracuse or Utica in upstate New York (where I am from and can admit they are shit holes). 

First of all, the overall incentives for committing a crime like a mugging or car jacking or way lower. People carry less cash. You can cancel all your cards when you get home. You can brick your phone from home. The only person worth robbing are drug dealers, who actually have something of value on them. And those people are not going to report anything (obviously). 

Second, it's way easier to get caught now. Everyone has a cell phone, there are cameras everywhere, it's impossible to get away with stealing a car, and poorer neighborhoods are heavily policed and surveilled. 

Third, gentrification. Entire neighborhoods have been transformed in places like NYC, pushing poorer residents outside to the outer boroughs or outside NYC altogether. 

There's still plenty of concentrated poverty, but even in those places certain parts of the neighborhood near commercial zones or train lines get gentrified. And with more gentrification comes greater police presences. 

All the stop and frisk and broken windows practices are bullshit. The only policing thing that matters are more police, on foot, discouraging people from posting up on a corner. Event that has its own problems. The only things that matter are incentives, economics, and urban planning/design. Street crime just isn't worth it most of the time. 

The real criminals in NYC are the landlords and wallstreet. And crime is way up with those fuckers. 

 Also the Freakanomics abortion thing always gets brought up and that's just eugenics asinine bullshit.I don't need your life story to tell you to go up a block and make a right to find Times Square. Just get to the fucking question.On an escalator? Stand fucking right. Walk fucking left.He's a big doofus who oversleeps.Part of it is reasonable complaints and policy issues; part of it is liberals thinking he doesn’t go far enough; part of it is more central folks that thinks he goes too far; part of it is police hating him sympathizing with Black Lives Matter. But a big part of it is trolls on Reddit flocking to discussion of him so they can lose their shit over him.Because he's a clown.

Wherever you are on his policies, his personality doesn't garner respect from jaded New Yorkers.

New York is a big city and its residents want a big city mayor. A guy or gal with a real personality and balls to match. Someone who knows how to pick a fight and win, and also how to say "go to hell" to the haters. And most importantly someone who is on top of their shit and gets things done.

De Blasio seems like a doofus who goes to the YMCA in the middle of the day in sweat pants, whines about the governor bullying him, and then flies off to Iowa to do some sort of white-guy-Obama schtick that nobody's buying. Kind of gives the opposite impression of "getting shit done".Well, take me. I'm a fairly progressive person.

I like that De Blasio froze my rent for a while. 

... and that's really all I can think of that he's done for me, personally. 

I've been amused watching the poorer neighborhoods get snow plowed while the wealthier neighborhoods scream bloody murder. 

I've also been horrified hearing that special needs kids got trapped in their bus when the city's response to a storm was underwhelming. 

I have enjoyed him being a pain-in-the-ass to Cuomo. I've also not enjoyed DB's being caught up in as many (if not more) scandals than Cuomo.

Generally speaking, De Blasio is someone I've tolerated as not really causing me any harm but not really doing me any particular favors. 

BUT LATELY... he has decided to run for President of the fucking United States of America. He's been absent from NYC. And he has demonstrated delusions of grandeur on a level I did not think possible from him. 

Why am I, a progressive, hating on De Blasio at all these days? Because he's become a laughing stock thinking that he can move on to national politics. He has done nothing to deserve it. Nothing. Meanwhile, there's shit to do back here in NYC. 

I, personally, was kind of "EH" about him until his run for 2020. Now I am counting the days to him leaving the news cycle, and becoming irrelevant.It took me about a year but one night you'll walk out of a bar, look up, and go, "fuck yeah. I live in new york city," and it will feel so, so good.Gesturing to me to take my headphones off on my 30 minute lunch break sitting down outside work on Wall St. to ask me where the fucking Bull is. Motherfucker, you have a smartphone with a GPS. LITERALLY WALK DOWN BWAY TO THE END. How could this possibly be any level of difficulty to comprehend by looking at Google Maps for five seconds? Seriously, HOW? 

Of course, I always politely oblige and point at Trinity Church, "take a left at the end of Wall St. at that church. That's Broadway. Broadway, the street. Walk three blocks, it ends at Bowling Green, you'll find the bull staring right at you. If you end up on a big orange boat, you missed it. Enjoy Staten Island." 

Yesterday, two people had the audacity to ask me "what's down there then" pointing towards FDR/East river, THEN "oh cool, well where's the WTC?" They ate up 20% of my lunch break to ask me where the tallest, most visible building in the Western Hemisphere is...Fairly new panhandling technique (I've only seen it within the past year or so) that seems to work very well because it invokes an emotional response. Chances are he would have done nothing, but of course no one wants to be the asshole who didn't donate $5 and watched a homeless guy jump under a trainHe's just milquetoast on every issue to the point where it's kind of offensive. And most of his policies and proposals are often half-baked and under-delivered. The dude pushes for fixing NYC schools and then puts a corrupt douchebag in charge and then runs off to Iowa and neglects the city. He campaigns on Vision Zero and then paints barely any bike lanes but calls them "protected" because they added striped paint to the sides of them, and while cyclist deaths hit higher rates in the first quarter of the year versus the entirety of last year, he tells the cops to crack down on cyclist behavior and claims bike lanes "aren't as important". He works behind the scenes to roll out the red carpet to Amazon and when they pull out he does a 180 and acts as though he was never for the deal all along and comes across as a two-faced asshole. The dude rides the subways once and when asked for his opinion, all he can blab out is that "people need their subways" meanwhile doing nothing in the media or legislatively to try and fix them. He wanted horses out of Central Park and failed on that shit too.

He's a narrow-minded, completely oblivious douchebag who has done nothing to deserve anything but ire and contempt from the city. He basically wants to have his cake and eat it too, but he's so transparent that it hurts.First year in NYC sucks hard. You are lucky in many ways, but you need a job friend. Then you will start being part of something, and make friends. Hang tough, NYC is a bee-yatch, but she is so worth it.What a piece of shit. It's a shame people gave him anything.No advice to offer you but I just gotta commend you for dealing with some of these bullshit comments. Jesus fuck.They're hispanic guys right?  also are you a female or male?

I've lived near bushwick before all the hipsters moved in.  It's was shit hole then, probably a slightly better shithole today.  Glad i got out.  Bunch of hispanics shouting racist shit all the time (I'm Asian) and trying to start fights with me all the time. Especially the younger high school hispanics that would hang out in groups.  All of this is unprovoked, just me walking by not even making eye contact with these scums.  They never act tough by themselves though, it's always in groups. Funny shitI don't know if most people do or not but you need renter's insurance. Period.

Unless you're well-off enough that you can replace all your shit if the building burns down or if some other disaster strikes.

Where you live doesn't matter. You need renter's insurance.

If you don't rent you need homeowner's.Worth it. Get it. It's NYC. Some shit will happen to you at some point. It's not expensive at all and trust me, when you get robbed will be at the point where you have no extra cash lying around to replace things. Just suck it up and do it.Doesn’t matter if “most” do. I did, and you should because if shit goes down, you don’t want to be left with nothing and nowhere to live.

It’s cheap enough that you shouldn’t need to think too hard about it.YES! We had a sprinkler malfunction in our apt which they tried to blame on us. 

The insurance fought them after they tried to legally come after us. 

Expensive ass high rise too. Life saver. We had just moved to the City and barely had our shit unboxed.

Remember, not everything is within your control!He does that shit all the time. Just mind your business and keep on living if you don’t want to donate, he ain’t killing himself.IDK if this is helpful but I'm a (small, gay) dude who lives in NJ and works in Manhattan so if you need something that can't be delivered to NY but can to NJ, hit me up.  I'm fucking angry on your behalf that you even have to ask this.  Be safe.Who cares- you need it.  It's telling that a scroll through these comments is 90% "don't be daft, of course you fucking need it" and 10% "i never had it and i've never needed it".

There are zero people saying "yeah, I needed it and didn't have it and it was fine" and zero people "I needed it and used it, and I wish I had my $110 a year back" and that alone should tell you something.Roll down your window and tell that dude to stop acting like a fool and scaring women. Then move on.

And make sure you let any of your male friends know that behavior won’t be tolerated around you. 

You don’t have to be anybody’s knight in shining armor.If she lives in Maspeth she is used to ass hats like this flexing in a Nissan. Probably realizes these jokes live in their mom’s basement at the age of 30. My wife was cat called the other day in neighboring Middle Village while walking our two young children to the park. These guys are a bunch of fucking lowlife underemployed losers with no manners - and they are pussies. They only will do it when they are in their car. My wife called them a disgusting pig - they called her a ‘fucking bitch’ in front of my kids. This is like at 2 in the afternoon on a weekday.Speaking as a woman who deals with catcalling and jerks like that often, it probably felt scarier / more shocking to you. We're used to ignoring these guys (and/or sometimes telling them to fuck off) and you definitely made the right choice by not offering her a ride - sweet of you to hang around waiting to see her get on the bus safely though.

&amp;#x200B;

If you wanted to signal you had her back so she could feel safer, maybe just politely tell the other guys to move along, and after they leave, say something like "I'm sorry about those assholes". If she keeps to herself, she might be uncomfortable with you approaching her but it's still nice to notice she isn't alone and someone's parked right there. At least from my (female) point of view."Hey fuck off, don't be a creepster!" to the dude is great. "Hey you ok there? Sorry that dude's a creepster" to the woman is nice and friendly. "Hey I'm a stranger, want to get in my car?" is creepy.those seem like reasonable assumptions. also most places I've lived only require first/deposit, not first/last/deposit, but obviously it's up to the particular landlord. 

deposit is usually = 1 month rent, unless landlords add shit on for you being a 'risky' tenant or having a pet or something (also fuck those landlords)

credit check should be included in the application fee (considering that's literally a big part of what they're checking), it'd be weird for them to charge separately but I guess anything is possible with the nickel and diming bastards here.

Also for the big checks (first month's rent, deposit, broker fee) they usually want you to have certified checks from your bank. The app fee they're typically flexible on how you pay.Everything I wanted to add has already been stated but I just wanted to say coming from a 22 year old female, thanks for giving a shit about this!It’s a luxury to have windows. My small ass bathroom feels like a Turkish sauna when the heat is on.Take care of the staff and they won't talk shit about you.Yes. All the fucking time. I literally had a guy try to tell a head of celery to me for $7 (it was $3 the week earlier), and then a box of sugar which was stamped $3, and said the register rang up $4.

I always give them shit about it.Yeah if you're not a regular you have to keep an eye on that and say something, otherwise they will keep doing it to you. 

There are several in my neighborhood that I will avoid just because they try and pull that shit, thinking people won't speak up.Fuck yes. They also gossip with other residents too.Get a credit card. Go to a bank. Payday lenders are shitty and can really fuck you up, but they are an option.The first stench of a dead person is usually shit. That then gets overwhelmed by a BO / rotting smell.Street car dude the other day tried charging me 4$ for a bottle of diet soda . I said bro I’m not a fucking tourist  “wearing construction clothes”  and he said sorry but it’s 4$ lololI lived in Switzerland for a couple months. After that, nothing here seemed too ridiculous.It’s fucking terrible. Such a “boring dystopia” vibe from the renovations. I go there for shooting on my lunch break and that’s about the most enjoyment I’ll ever get from there.

Years ago I remember Pier 17 being the place to be, bars, restaurants, and even a fake sand area to just hang out with some beautiful views.$9 for the pod-size Poland Spring bottle of water at Marquee Nightclub.  They don't allow you to get tap water.  Even though everyone's dancing, drinking, sweating, and partying hard for hours into the night.  Someone could die of dehydration, so seriously, **fuck that place**.bj's 

in america it's sashimi grade if it's frozen after it's caught to kill those parasitesIt is fucking insane that there is no subway service to LGA. Like what in the world?Who’s the fuck tips toll collectors ? I never heard of that before . No I don’t and never have , never even crossed my mind . 

And you’re comparing engineers with toll collectors ? Most jobs there’s reasons for their pay scales . How needed they are and how much you need to know to be able to preform it . 

I work construction and when you look at the guy who sweeps the floor making 41$hr and the plumber who makes 65$hr you don’t go damn they both should be making the same . You go yeah, plumbers do more and need to know more .How much are they offering your ass ? 

If you tell me 125k or more I’d say shut up . Shit 100k or more sit your ass down. 

80k single no kids you’ll do just fine . Especially if there’s room to grow within the company . Anything less it could get a little middle class budgeting counting every penny type of scenario .

But anything over 60k you can make it happen . Below that I’d say fuck it and stay home and keep looking


Edit: seen your salary 49k . Ain’t worth it .Because it's sushi at a fucking deli.Hey guys. This lobster I ordered at the diner is fucking awful. What diners do you go to for lobster?Walk the few blocks over to K-town for some bomb-ass Korean food?Yeah fuck that . If they were in her room then it’s whatever. But if you gotta come home from working all day for them to be chilling in the living room 4 nights a week that’s where I draw the line . Who wants to feel like a guest in their own house . 

I don’t know what he might be using that she isn’t using that would warrant him to have to pay anything . 

But I would def have a talk with her about staying in her room !Get a really nice couch, not fucking IkeaWtf is this dude doing walking around the apartment without pants? He can’t toss on some basketball shorts like a normal American? I don’t know what to tell you about bills, but you can damn sure tell your room mate that this guy needs to get dressed before leaving her bedroom.&gt; hangs out shirtless/pantless in the public space frequently.

Fuck that noise.  That would be a big fucking "nope" for me.Not getting called a faggot constantly. It happens, but not constantly.Went home with this chick from the bar . I was a little bit past tipsy . She stuck her finger in my ass while
Having sex . I almost kneed her head of her shoulders .Driving through the Lincoln tunnel last year and I saw the remnants of a motorcycle accident. The dude's head was clean off his body still in his helmet. Everyone was just driving past the accident at normal speed. Really fuckin weird and sad, felt so bad for the guy and situation.One thing I learned in the military was how to wear a ruck/backpack .  Light shit in the bottom , heavy shit up top . Try to have it as high on back/shoulders as you can without looking like a dummy cause it’s nyc not the military . That dangling back pack mid back will over time fuck you up and might be walking differently to compensate. 

Also walking is more endurance then strength so it doesn’t matter how much you lift . You should be doing some form of running/sprinting .Elderly , disabled , pregnant . Everyone else fuck off . 

A 7yo could stand on their head for hours without missing a beat , I think he can stand up for the 10 min train ride . I’m 25 and work construction and on my feet literally all day long . It’s always some suit/office worker who’s been sitting down all day who has something to say .yes, you are the asshole. 

If you yourself aren't elderly or have a disability that causes it to be difficult for you to stand, you should give up your seat for - a mother with children, or an elderly person, or a pregnant woman.I would highly suggest finish your degree, building a portfolio, and getting a job offer before moving to the city. NYC is not a good place to fuck around for months on end - you'll blow through thousands of dollars in a couple months."without paying ridiculous garage fees or having all my shit stolen" - no.This would be a pain in the ass on mass transit. Get the car.It’s funny cause they say if you make x amount you’ll pay x amount . And I’m always like I make that much but how the fuck am I suppose to pay that much lol . 

But if I won I’d prop take it just for the fact you could be able to sell/rent after a certain period of time . At least I think you can !People are super nosy here. My building has both rented and owned units so whenever I meet a new neighbor their first question is always whether I rent or own. None of your fucking business, Karen.Grow the fuck up.I have super curly hair and it’s long and this weather has been the dicks. My hair poofs up, if I tie it , it takes the shape of whatever I tie it up to. So I just opted to put my hair in two braids . You’re better off doing a braided hairstyle of some kind like a crown braid or something. It’s the only thing that’ll keep it intact.I work blue collar so I don’t generally give a fuck during the week . I just put on some deodorant a new shirt when i head home . 

But any other time I always wear a ginny tee under . It’s a life saver .I just learned that antiperspirant deodorant is for people who sweat a lot.

I remember my first day at starting my new job, I walked to the train and looked [that soccer player at the end of his interview.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPJ910N9Rdo)

Honestly, around this time. I focus on how fast I move and slow that the fuck down. On some days its impossible but on my lunch break and before/after work it's a life saver. 

Or workout and fuck a shirt.Buy TALCUM POWDER aka Baby Powder 

Put that shit under your pits after applying antiperspirant deodorant and of course, if you're a guy, a quick coat on your sack 

Carry mini deodorant from any pharmacy and a small bottle of baby powder 


p.s - If you also have greasy shiny hair, baby powder helps that too. Makes it look clean ishI have a 4 year old and a 7 month old. It fucking sucks.I knew someone who was on Rikers for a few months for a nonviolent crime, he said his biggest issue was privacy, specifically the lack of it. He entered a program while he was there that taught him chef skills and landed him a job as soon as he got out. He said it wasn’t horrible as long as you kind your business and don’t act like an idiot. I also remember he was there in the summer and said it was hot as hell tho.Headbands, fam. You look dumb as shit but they are a godsendAs far as I’m concerned, socks attract and keep way more shit than bare feet and are still porous enough that it touches your skin anyway. Hard pass.It’s not better than say, wearing your underwear over your pants or anything, but no one would give a fuck if you did either.I drive daily. Cyclists don't bother me most of the time. We need to share the road.


But holy fuck they scare me going the wrong way out of nowhere when I'm a pedestrian.it will be a huge pain in the ass even for able bodied people. you may need to look into overpriced cruises or private events.So uh. I think I live in your neighborhood and I have a 1” button maker and a ton of extra backs and stuff. IDK how soon you need this or what your deal is or if our schedules will work but I could lug it to a local bar and we can make shit. I will offer my machine &amp; supplies for the price of a pint if you’re interested.&gt;Is this financially foolish?

Yes.I was walking behind a dude smoking a cigar today and that shit smells WAY worse than weed.shit the nyc parks and rec gym used to always be $25, used that for years

thanks for the info on fresh food boxMice are a problem, but doable. Get a live mice trap, prep it with some peanut butter and you'll capture all of them. Release them somewhere abandoned or the park (they'll  end up hawk food, but the circle of life little buddies). Plug every opening with steel wool. The combo of that and the trap and it's no big deal.

Rats on the other hand are just disgusting and so much harder to deal with. New York rats will probably fuck up your cat in a 1:1 fight. I have a backyard and my screen door isn't completely covered at the bottom. My worst fear is one of those fuckers runs in and I'll have to burn down my apartment to get rid of it.Nope. I grew up on Pizza Hut and Dominoes in suburbia. I loved Papa Johns during college over 15 years ago. Tried it recently. Tastes like shit. I'll take NYC style especially grandma slice over any chain pizza any day.This is stupid. It’s not 1993, there’s no cheap places to live while you figure your shit out. Don’t do this.Would you get in trouble with the cops?  Maybe.  Cops tend not to know shit about the law, so you could well get hassled.  But you’re basically talking about the equivalent of a skateboard, and those are legal on sidewalks so long as you ride them safely and not in a way that endangers others.  So, yeah, it’s legal, but I can’t guarantee that any random cop will know that.

(Disclaimer:  this isn’t legal advice — so if you get in trouble that’s your own damned problem.)Someone told you need to speak to random strangers who approach you in NYC? This person was fucking with you.Jackson Heights could be good (by the express stop.) There are some nice quiet blocks. F access to Briarwood, E/F/R/7 access to Manhattan. Sunnyside/Woodside are nice, but you may rely on the 7 train alone (unless you go to the area between the 7 and R) and your commute might get fucked some days.This is a troll post, right? Even with the things that's been lost, this is still New York Fucking City, and you're worried she will be bored?  
You say she's "arty", well you may have heard about the museums and galleries here.  
If this is not a troll, what you really should worry about is her meeting someone who gives her a bit more credit and understanding.Holy shit a family of 5 in a loft in Bushwick that’s 2500? You guys are going to be packed in like sardines.8 million people all bored as fuck every day. I don’t even know why people live here in these tiny over priced apartments, there’s literally nothing to do.Seems like they are home a lot to be pulling all this shit. If you’re not around as much as them you’re never going to win. You might snag an occasional spot off them if they slip but overall they seem pretty dedicated.  

My super and his family used to pull that shit. They had it locked down. I mean they work in the building so they were impossible to beat for a spot. Their cars were dead out front every day. And that was in the city. True pros. 

It would piss me off big time, the gap parking and shit. That’s why I don’t have a car, don’t need that stress.After the kid is 1, daycare will be at LEAST $12,000 a year. Under six months, daycare costs $FUCKYOU.Why is your windowsill so filthy?I'd go Fios, Spectrum is trash.No, you'll be killed immediately.Your landlord is full of shit.

They can ask, sure. And if they’re willing to refund some of your rent, I’d consider doing it. But if they’re not, tell them to pound sand. 

It’s not your problem that they didn’t give themselves enough time to flip the apartment. 

If they send you a bill for those days, don’t pay it. Tell them to take you to court. They won’t win.They cannot. And since they're being dicks, I'd stay in the apt until 11:55pm the day of and not allow them in. Document everything. I'd even hold last months rent and use the security deposit towards the last month.I doubt you’re going to wait till the last day to move everything out but I don’t care if you move out a week before don’t tell those dick heads . 

They’re bullshitting you . Hope
You have your paper work together just Incase they’re dumber then they sound .sounds like a good thing you're moving out because that landlord is a scumbag and Mao would like a wordThe landlord started his relationship with his new tenants with a lie based upon pushing you out based on a lie.  Your landlord is a scum bag.  If he threatens you again, call him a slum lord and you'll see him in court.I assume you gave a security deposit? Since this is illegal and you have every right to stay put, take pictures of EVERY inch of that place. Even videos. Do this on your last day when everything has been moved out. Floors, walls, doorknobs. Everything. This asshole is gonna come up with a reason to keep your deposit since you’re not allowing him to kick you out early, illegally. Don’t let him win.Nope. You paid rent, you stay. They want you out early, they return that money. Thats it. Dont pay for August. If they try to threaten going to court over it, it wont hold up anyway. Fuck that guy.Because people are disgusting.Dividers that go to the ceiling are against fire code and they endanger you, everyone in the apartment, and the firefighters trying to save your sorry ass.dead ass, it's pretty common here.lol long assYou can definitely be evicted for doing illegal shit in your apartment.Yeah bras literally make it so I can’t breathe due to my extreme asthma so naturally I don’t wear them. And I guarantee I make more than you’ll ever make. AssholeBitch ass

And my favorite mark ass bitch


Edit: also giant ass xxx (but usually followed by bitch)


Edit 2: mark ass trick is also favoriteHave you tried looking for jobs in Albany or even Massachusetts? I moved to northern Westchester thinking I’d keep commuting to Manhattan and even that (relatively) short distance killed me after about a month before I just said fuck it and found something up hereWaste of time, don't bother with Bowery Bliss. It's pretty terrible and like many similar places out there mostly exists to sucker horny idiots who don't know any better to part with a decent chunk of change for a subpar party that usually ends up being a total skeevy sausage fest.

The only thing they have going for them is having something relatively more frequently but in this situation you'd definitely want to be seeking quality over quantity.

If you check on Fetlife groups for NYC, you'll be able to get a feel for the more legitimate and better ran setups out there. I know I've seen some events/groups out there with solid quality control on keeping out creeps and abusers.The fuck...come on over to brooklyn so i can slap you in the faceMasturbate to gay porn?Yeah that's sloppy fucking work and your health might pay the price. The ambient humidity here is high enough that shit isn't going to magically dry out quickly on its own.I recently moved from UWS to Harrison while working in the Financial District. I commute every day and love it. I get more space and the commute time is near identical.

Main disadvantage is that weekend service SUCKS.My boss’ husband was a higher up at the MTA. One day they had issues so bad that half the trains were not running. By coincidence I met him the following day and jokingly asked what the hell happened? He genuinely had no clue what i was talking about because “everything’s always fucked anyway”Wherever you wind up, make sure your apartment is ten blocks or less from the train. Beyond that, it would be a real pain in the ass. I live in a place where I'm ten blocks away from three different subway lines; as I like to say, it's inconvenient to all the trains (which is actually good, if one line is down, there's always another one available).Did 1 summer a couple years back without a ac. 

Most nights and days for that matter were bearable with a fan on and windows open . Hardly noticeable. But those fucking nights during the summer where it’s still  still 90+ out were brutal . Like torture status . And just had to get through it with a wet rag lololThis definitely doesn’t happen unless you’re a huge assholeWho the fuck doesn't have AC in this city?Dumb shiti find a fuck buddy who doesThey probably *had* to, I doubt parents are going around on the subway at 1 o clock in the morning with their young children for fun. People have reasons to do shit man just mind your business.I dunno, I think NYC is a great place to be antisocial. Nobody gives a shit. If you move to the midwest or something you'll have to explain to everyone you bump into how your day is going because they all pretend like they care. Aint nobody got time for that.I think the reason for your unhappiness might be tied more to the fact that you're living with your parents at this age rather than location. I think it's just in our dna to feel deep down we should be on our own at that age. 

Social anxiety is a bitch. We dread interaction with anyone but isolation isn't healthy at all. The inevitable loneliness fucks with you big time. 

Idk what advice really to give you but just consider that a location change isn't necessarily going to fix everything.at Sean Casey Animal Rescue you can come by and just check out a dog to take for a walk - it's the shit &lt;3This looks like some Cutco Knives mass interview crapWhy the fuck everything has to be so fucking expensive. Used to $3 box of cereal? Gristedes demands $8.Alamo. They use real butter and not that artificial shit.1. A few thousand, though I had zero intention on using it (had a job lined up). 
2. An old suitcase full of my clothes and nothing else, bayby!
3. Don't worry that shitty job you took is only going to last a few months before you move somewhere you love.
4. Great! Its a lot like living literally anywhere else except the rent is higher, the food is better, and there are super nice parks and transit around. (F**k cars am i right?)

Unless you have a super YOLO attitude about things, I'd recommend at least trying to get a job first before moving here unless you can find a situation in which you'll be paying just a few hundred in rent. It just makes things so much easier, if not effortless, if when you move you can land on your feet with some income to cover a 1300+ rent.Is this a shitpost? Who tf cares.Is this a shitpost? Who tf cares?People who argue that the city should remain shitty because it's always been shitty. Defending people who walk/ride around blaring terrible music, for example. Being a piece of shit is not somebody's culture, and nothing of cultural value will be lost if they are made to stop.

Also, people who don't understand how to use public spaces. Stay to the right when walking, biking, and driving. Don't block the entrance to the train. Don't try to get on until people have gotten off. It's not complicated.Manspreading on the subway(I'm a 6'2" guy btw). If you take up more than one space, especially when there's no other seats, you are a massive piece of shit. I can't even fathom how people have the audacity to lounge out like they're in their personal La-Z boy when everyone else is packed like a sardine, overtly projecting to everyone how shamelessly disrespectful they are. One time I squeezed into a spot where the guy's knee was fully extended over my lap, assuming he would take the hint, but instead he gave me a grunt and a death stare as if I'm the asshole. FUCK YOU dude....When someone on line gets up to the counter at the bodega and doesn’t begin their order with a “lemme getttttah”

But seriously slow walkers....Tourist, I understand, they gawk and don’t know better. NY’ers, pick up the fucking pace. You aren’t faster then the rest of the US.On July 5th, it's going to be the assholes setting off fireworks. In general, inconsiderate people who make noise late at night - people who blast their car stereo or rev their loud obnoxious motorcycles.Sounds like your friends are complete idiots.People that modify their car engines to be loud as f**ck for no reason.

People blasting music on their cellphones on subway.**SantaCon**. Sidewalks are clogged and fuckers don't move, drunken idiots pissing everywhere (even more human piss than what is usually spread about the city), and the sexy elf outfit annoys the shit out of me for some reason.

**Airbnb**. I despise that my apartment complex has become a hotel. New rentals in my building are snatched up and immediately groups with suitcases start arriving at the rental unit.

**Mega-sized golf umbrellas**. Stop being a selfish asshole and get a normal umbrella.

**Cars and bikes that don't yield to crosswalk**. Especially bikers that then shout at me or give me the evil eye when running through the red light.How much people complain about the MTA and how little appreciation is shown to the MTA workers that are getting everyone's ass around 24/7.Cunts that ride bikes, or worse, motorized bikes on the sidewalkEveryone is talking about slow walkers, but what about people that walk with their stupid faces pointing straight down glued to their stupid phones? I know this isn't NYC but sweet fucking jesus.Constant sirens, and usually for no fucking reason at all.When people are on Facetime or video calls in public spaces with no fucking headphones on. or when you're speedwalking through times square and trying to avoid dudes pushing shit into your hands and still get heckled when you try to politely turn them down. Lived here my whole life and this place still irritates the shit out of me sometime lolSubways are too fucking hot because they don't invest in modern infrastructurepeople that honk their car horn while stuck in traffic. fuck that noise (literally). the car horn does not mean "i'm frustrated and now you have to hear this noise pollution".Littering, slow walkers, T&amp;LC drivers. The trifecta. 

* I see lots of scumbags throwing their plastic coffee cups on the floor or discarding wrapping papers on the street.

* People who think they can go at their own pace on a high volume street. I'm not a violent person but if you're able-bodied then move the fuck out of the way. 

* T&amp;LC drivers are the worst fucking drivers in NYC. No yield lights to indicate they want to pull over, never using their indicators, they're either speeding drastically over the speed limit or going 5 MPH on any street. Even the fucking freeways.[Tsuru Ton Tan](https://www.tsurutontan.com/union-square) in Union Square is phenomenalWHERE DO I BEGIN
