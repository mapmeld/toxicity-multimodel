>>>>You really shouldn't switch lanes in the Lincoln tunnel, it is illegal and will result in a ticket if you get caught/they actually look at the cameras and send out tickets in the mail. Plus, I wouldn't because it can be really dangerous (i.e. the left lane isn't moving but right lane is totally free, you slowly inch out to get in the right lane, guy is barreling down the right lane and not paying much attention, slams into you because your suddenly in the right lane and he isn't expecting people to switch lanes because its illegal)

So from my observations the way the tunnel lanes work is the  following: (coming from the hook around in Hoboken) the right most lane usually* goes only downtown (towards 36th street), the left right tunnel lane sometimes does the same sometimes is open for both northbound and southbound traffic, the right lane of the middle tunnel, usually both northbound and southbound, and the left middle tunnel (rush hour only? Not sure on this one) I would assume is once again downtown only.  If I were you I'd shoot for the right most lanes since you said you weren't going through during rush hour.

*warning: the Lincoln tunnel does what it wants without warning so on many occasions I go right tunnel left lane and have been forced downtown anyways.

The outer boroughs have only a touch of it when you get around the fringes (eg Bay Ridge, Queens Village, etc). It starts to creep in on Staten Island, as well as Westchester and Nassau counties. Suffolk and Putnam have some rednecks, and the rest of NY State is definitely filled with them. In my travels, I found even San Francisco to be a little rednecky (just a tiny hair), and L.A. has a surprising amount of Larry the Cable Guys driving around in pickups.
>>>>You  DO realize it take 10 minutes to get to the UES (59th st) from Astoria on the subway right. Everyone  living in Manhattan believes that living  anywhere else is like HOURS from civilization. And I can tell you the reason someone is paying that little in Astoria is because they must have a very spefific landlord. I pay $1250 for my half of a 2 bedroom for a room exactly that size.

But if your social circle is a bunch of finance bros who wouldnt dream in setting foot in the filth that is Astoria definitely dont move here.

Granted it takes longer to get around but i mean its a choice. I personally  love Astoria because of the space i get.

That being said its terrible dont move here ever.

Really sell it if you need to - what day works best for you to meet my lawyer, mr slumlord?

A lot of these Hasidic slumlords have been screwing tenants for decades and they're really good at it so remember you need to really twist their arm to get any sort of repair.   If you still don't get any movement from them, start calling in building code and sanitation violations for your building (broken hallway lights, recycling in the garbage) - it's super easy to get ticketable offenses written up for the property owner and the non-stop stream of tickets issued to the owner will motivate them.

I had a particularly bad landlord when I was in Brooklyn but we came to working agreement - he permanently fixed my heater and then the almost daily property tickets from the sanitation department would magically stop - it worked out great for everyone in the end :)

You will need food stamps, utilities subsidies, medicaid. Get on [Access NYC](https://a069-access.nyc.gov/ACCESSNYC/application.do) and apply for every social services program in existence the minute you arrive, and be prepared to fight a lot of bureaucrats to get what you need. They will demand every official form of paperwork you've ever gotten in your life from your birth certificate to your social security card to your utility bills to mail to medical bills. Many of them perceive their job as looking through your files for any excuse possible to deny you benefits, so don't get caught unprepared and document every contact you have with them for when they say they "didn't receive" your paperwork later.

If work does not pay for transit, try to ask for swipes from people with unlimited cards getting off the subway, and find unmonitored subway stations where you can get away with occasionally jumping the turnstiles. Get a bike if you live close enough to work to bike commute. Never eat out, and only do free things when you go out (there's plenty of parks, museums, and neighborhoods to stroll through).

If your current living situation isn't sustainable and you need to move at some point, you will also need to live in a 'bad' neighborhood very far from the city center, or in Jersey. Much of the Bronx is still pretty cheap, as are places in Queens &amp; Brooklyn at the last couple of subway stops like Flushing, Ridgewood, Jamaica, and Brownsville - and they're all really cool neighborhoods. Just focus on which one gets you the most tolerable commute and invest in good media to keep you entertained on the long subway rides. If Manhattan or hipster Brooklyn is a must for you, then you're gonna have to share your bedroom to make rent.

Finally, credit cards and support from relatives can help bridge the gaps that will come up quite often, like needing a new pair of shoes or a cavity filling. Because your income is so low you may qualify for many charitable things too like free interview clothes. That takes more research. Ultimately just don't be ashamed of any of this. At that income you are fully entitled to what little shreds of the social safety net that still exists these days.
>>>>Movies are not real life. Firstly, straight razor shaves are illegal in NYC for health reason, they need to use a shavette with a disposable blade.

There are massive swaths of brooklyn queens and the bronx which have not really even been touched by that shit. Even Bed-Stuy and Harlem and bushwick are still 90%+ black and hispanic still. I know not all gentrifiers are white, but its usually a good easy way to tell how much a neighborhood has gentrified. A tea shop on a corner does not mean your neighborhood is suddenly park slope.

Are we as gritty and downtrodden as in the 70s? No, of course not. But we aren't San Francisco or Portland level gentrified yet. Brooklyn has a gdp per capita closer to Cleveland and Baltimore. The south bronx is the poorest congressional district in the entire COUNTRY. We have a long way to go until this city is on the same level as many other cities in this country when it comes to gentrification.

>>>>You're seeing the remnants of Little Ebonia, an ethnic enclave that thrived early last century.  Most migration to New York City from Elbonia was from the region of West Elbonia (next to the Duchy of Grand Fenwick; there's a border dispute there so the borders have changed since fall of the Soviet Union), which specialized in producing tobacco products for the Belgrade Treaty countries.  Naturally, these immigrants took up the trade they knew best once they passed through Ellis Island and settled here.

Little Elbonia was significantly larger, stretching from east to Columbus and up to around W. 105th Street, but, over the decades, Elbonians assimilated with the general American population, and moved out to the suburbs.  The end of the neighborhood as a distinct enclave happened with urban redevelopment in the 1960s, though by that time few Elbonians remained in the area.

Those smoke shops are a poignant reminder of what once was.

To answer your questions:

1) Even if you have to go through immigration, there's more than enough time.

2) Cab is the easiest, and not that much more expensive then the shuttles. Worth the difference for the convenience. The ride will be about 20-25 mins, add in a bit of waiting for the cab and you're looking at 45 mins from exiting JFK to arriving at LGA.

I live in Manhattan, work in White Plains and have inlaws out on LI, and I'd much rather drive between WHP and LI than deal with LIRR, MTA and Metro North.

>>>>It's natural to feel bad about it sometimes, there are for sure some genuine homeless that need a little help ... but at the same time the majority of beggars take advantage of others empathy and I don't want to encourage it, so I find it best to donate to actual charities instead.
>>>>No. There's no way to know who's conning you and who isn't.

Also, the majority of the panhandlers I encounter are on the subway, which is illegal and also just obnoxious.

If you feel guilt or just a desire to help, donate time or money to a charity. I don't have a comprehensive list of homeless outreach charities, but an example option is BRC in Chelsea, which seems reputable.

>>>>Try leafleting your area with Know Your Rights documents in English and in Spanish. I've been leaving them at local bodegas, restaurants, other places where I know Latinos would be. You can get them from any immigration nonprofit or print them off one's website.
>>>>City of Dreams is fantastic! It's massive but it has everything about immigration to the city from the Dutch era to now.
>>>>Mice are a problem, but doable. Get a live mice trap, prep it with some peanut butter and you'll capture all of them. Release them somewhere abandoned or the park (they'll  end up hawk food, but the circle of life little buddies). Plug every opening with steel wool. The combo of that and the trap and it's no big deal.

Rats on the other hand are just disgusting and so much harder to deal with. New York rats will probably fuck up your cat in a 1:1 fight. I have a backyard and my screen door isn't completely covered at the bottom. My worst fear is one of those fuckers runs in and I'll have to burn down my apartment to get rid of it.
>>>>Your landlord is full of shit.

They can ask, sure. And if they’re willing to refund some of your rent, I’d consider doing it. But if they’re not, tell them to pound sand.

It’s not your problem that they didn’t give themselves enough time to flip the apartment.

If they send you a bill for those days, don’t pay it. Tell them to take you to court. They won’t win.
>>>>Tell them you have legal right to occupy the apartment until the end of your lease, and they are not illegally allowed to charge you extra because they'd like you to leave early. Leases don't work like that.
>>>>I doubt you’re going to wait till the last day to move everything out but I don’t care if you move out a week before don’t tell those dick heads .

They’re bullshitting you . Hope
You have your paper work together just Incase they’re dumber then they sound .
>>>>Agree with everyone else but you should double check your lease to make sure that there isn't some obscure paragraph that lets them do this. Might make things difficult for you if they do take it to court.

edit for clarification: I've seen some sneaky stuff in leases and not everyone reads theirs carefully. If they're the type of scummy landlord that would do this to someone, I wouldn't put it past them to sneak something into a lease. Of course I'm not a lawyer so I don't know what laws are against that.
>>>>The landlord started his relationship with his new tenants with a lie based upon pushing you out based on a lie.  Your landlord is a scum bag.  If he threatens you again, call him a slum lord and you'll see him in court.
>>>>I assume you gave a security deposit? Since this is illegal and you have every right to stay put, take pictures of EVERY inch of that place. Even videos. Do this on your last day when everything has been moved out. Floors, walls, doorknobs. Everything. This asshole is gonna come up with a reason to keep your deposit since you’re not allowing him to kick you out early, illegally. Don’t let him win.
>>>>Because people are disgusting.
>>>>This is super illegal.  After you move out, name and shame them.  There's nothing wrong with warning the new tenants, either.
>>>>Yes these women are all jobless and cant afford bras. Please throw a dollar them on the street if you see them. They’re in such need of your help. /s
>>>>lol long ass
>>>>Bitch ass

Trick ass

Mark ass

And my favorite mark ass bitch


Edit: also giant ass xxx (but usually followed by bitch)


Edit 2: mark ass trick is also favorite
>>>>Waste of time, don't bother with Bowery Bliss. It's pretty terrible and like many similar places out there mostly exists to sucker horny idiots who don't know any better to part with a decent chunk of change for a subpar party that usually ends up being a total skeevy sausage fest.

The only thing they have going for them is having something relatively more frequently but in this situation you'd definitely want to be seeking quality over quantity.

If you check on Fetlife groups for NYC, you'll be able to get a feel for the more legitimate and better ran setups out there. I know I've seen some events/groups out there with solid quality control on keeping out creeps and abusers.
>>>>Roaches are everywhere. Like ants, spiders, flies, you will probably see one or more while you're in NYC.

A well-kept building with regular pest control should keep sightings to a minimum. Newer buildings, higher floors also decrease the likelihood you'll see them often. In addition, if you keep your place clean and keep food wrapped up and put away, you don't give them much reason to enter your place.

But.

Restaurants on the ground floors, high concentrations of trash/dumpsters nearby, filthy hoarder neighbors, these can all have spillover effects to you.

Bottom line, look for a well-kept building without a bar or restaurant on the ground floor, which has a good live-in super and no weird smells coming from neighbors. Look for an apartment on a higher floor. Keep clean. And get over your fears. There are plenty of things more likely to kill you in NYC.
>>>>The amount of abuse or physical violence bus drivers have to deal with.  From shitty customers, to people acting violent if you stop them for not paying, to crazies and homeless people.  There are no barriers between you and the craziness of the city.  A big issue is bus drivers getting spit on by customers (happens way too often).

MTA workers get a lot of shit, but certain jobs like bus drivers put in a lot of work.  If you show up even a minute late for a shift, you get sent back home without pay for the shift (or you have to sit there for hours hoping that a shift opens up).  Overtime means you're on the road driving a bus, so you really can't fake it.
>>>>This looks like some Cutco Knives mass interview crap
>>>>I don't live in New York so I don't know if my comment will be welcomed here but I DO live in Louisiana. We get cockroaches here and as many have said, they don't discriminate. You can keep a spotless house and still get one in from time to time. Even the uptown matrons in their multi million dollars old family money mansions get them. The will come in from outside or they can come in through the pipes. When they come in they are usually looking for water it's just nature doing it's thing. They are all nasty but when you see the little ones that's when you have a problem, an occasional large one, you kill, dispose of, clean the area and try to not burn down your house and move on. I get the phobia thing though I am legit terrified of bugs. My husband knows by my scream if I see a bug. There is a saying that everyone is gangsta until the cockroach flies. Shivers.  I will say, we just had one that got in the house the other day and when I saw it my inner bad ass took over and I grabbed the spray and sprayed it DEAD. It was a good day.
>>>>&gt; Since they are planning to kick me out tomorrow

Well, if it's that illegal.. that could be transpassing and/or A&amp;B

Go talk to your local police station, set yourself up to record everything maybe even live broadcast on youtube/FB.
>>>>The constant filth which seems to have gotten much worse in the last 10 years or so. And when people stand on the left side of the escalator. They’re usually the same people that try to enter the subway before letting people out.
>>>>Sounds like your friends are complete idiots.
read about the city), and the sexy elf outfit annoys the shit out of me for some reason.

**Airbnb**. I despise that my apartment complex has become a hotel. New rentals in my building are snatched up and immediately groups with suitcases start arriving at the rental unit.

**Mega-sized golf umbrellas**. Stop being a selfish asshole and get a normal umbrella.

**Cars and bikes that don't yield to crosswalk**. Especially bikers that then shout at me or give me the evil eye when running through the red light.
>>>>Try tanoreen and mid east bskery plus vesuvio or ginos for food. Theres alot to do in that area. Skinflints or firehouse are good bars. Bay ridge has century 21 and faiccos right in bensonurst. For sushi or asian,try fushimi
